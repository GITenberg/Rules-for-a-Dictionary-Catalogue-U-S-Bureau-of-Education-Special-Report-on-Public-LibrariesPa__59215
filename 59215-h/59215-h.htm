<h2 class="h2herein" id="p003">PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>

<p>There are plenty of treatises on classification, of which
accounts may be found in Edwards’s Memoirs of Libraries and
Petzholdt’s Bibliotheca Bibliographica. The classification
of the St. Louis Public School Library Catalogue is
briefly defended by W. T. Harris in the preface (which
is reprinted, with some additions, from the Journal of
Speculative Philosophy for 1870). Professor Abbot’s plan
is explained in a pamphlet printed and in use at Harvard
College Library, also in his “Statement respecting the New
Catalogue” (part of the report of the examining committee
of the library for 1863), and in the North American Review
for January, 1869. The plan of Mr. Schwartz, librarian of
the Apprentices’ Library, New York, is partially set forth
in the preface to his catalogue; and a fuller explanation
is preparing for publication. For an author-catalogue
there are the famous 91 rules of the British
Museum&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">[1]</a>
(prefixed to the Catalogue of Printed Books, Vol. 1, 1841,
or conveniently arranged in alphabetical order by Th.
Nichols in his Handbook for Readers at the British Museum,
1866); Professor Jewett’s modification of them (Smithsonian
Report on the Construction of Catalogues, 1852); Mr.
F. B. Perkins’s further modification (in the American
Publisher for 1869), and a chapter in the second volume
of Edwards.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">[2]</a>
But for a dictionary-catalogue as a whole,
and for most of its parts, there is no manual whatever.
Nor have any of the above-mentioned works attempted to set
forth the rules in a systematic way or to investigate what
might be called the first principles of cataloguing. It is
to be expected that a first attempt will be incomplete,
and I shall be obliged to librarians for criticisms,
objections, or new problems, with or without solutions.
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
With such assistance perhaps a second edition of these
hints would deserve the
title—Rules.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">[3]</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1" id="fn1">[1]</a>
Compiled by a committee of five, Panizzi, Th.
Watts, J. Winter Jones, J. H. Parry, and E. Edwards, in
several months of hard labor.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">[2]</a>
To these may now be added: Condensed rules for
an author and title catalogue, prepared by the co-operation
committee, A. L. A. (printed in the Appendix of the
present Rules); F: B. Perkins’s San Francisco cataloguing
(1884); C: Dziatzko’s Instruction für die Ordnung der
Titel im alphabetischen Zettelkatalog der Univ. Bibliothek
zu Breslau (1886), of which an adaptation by Mr. K. A:
Linderfelt will shortly be published; Melvil Dewey’s
Condensed rules for a card catalogue, with 36 sample cards
(published in the <i>Library</i> <i>notes</i>, v. 1, no. 2, 1886, and
reprinted as “Rules for author and classed catalogs;” with
changes, additions, and a “Bibliography of catalog rules”
by Mary Salome Cutler, Boston, 1888, and again as “Library
School rules,” Boston, 1889); G. Fumagalli’s Cataloghi di
biblioteche (1887); H: B. Wheatley’s How to catalogue a
library (1889); and various discussions in the <i>Library
journal</i>, the <i>Neuer</i> <i>Anzeiger</i>, and the <i>Centralblatt für
Bibliothekswesen.</i></p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc3" id="fn3">[3]</a>
In this second edition I have retained the
discussions of principles of the first edition and added
others, because it seems to me to be quite as important to
teach cataloguers the theory, so that they can catalogue
independently of rules, as to accustom them to refer
constantly to hard and fast rules. The index, which will be
published separately, has been enlarged so as to form an
alphabetical or “dictionary” arrangement of the rules.</p></div>

DICTIONARY CATALOGUE.</h2>

<p>No code of cataloguing could be adopted in all points
by every one, because the libraries for study and the
libraries for reading have different objects, and those
which combine the two do so in different proportions.
Again, the preparation of a catalogue must vary as it is
to be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it
is to be merely an index to the library, giving in the
shortest possible compass clues by which the public can
find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information
on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain
regard to what may be called style. Without pretending
to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogues into
short-title, medium-title, and full-title or bibliographic;
typical examples of the three being, 1º, the Boston
Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2º,
the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenæum
(1874–82); 3º, the author-part of the Congress (1869) and
the Surgeon-General’s (1872–74) or least abridged of any,
the present card catalogue of the Boston Public Library. To
avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as “the full
catalogue of a large library” and “a concise finding list,”
I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as
proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short
family are not all of the same size, that there is more
than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest.
Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if
printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally
to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium
does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds
four lines, and gets many titles into a single line. Full
usually fills three or four lines and often takes six or
seven for a title.</p>

<p>The number of the following rules is not owing to any
complexity of system, but to the number of cases to which
a few simple principles have to be applied. They are
especially designed for Medium, but may easily be adapted
to Short by excision and marginal notes. The almost
universal practice of printing the shelf-numbers or the
class-numbers renders some of them unnecessary for town and
city libraries.</p>

<i>Note to second</i> <i>edition.</i> This statement of
Objects and Means has been criticized; but as it has also
been frequently quoted, usually without change or credit,
in the prefaces of catalogues and elsewhere, I suppose it
has on the whole been approved.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc5" id="fn5">[5]</a>

important member. The full name would be form-and-language

<h3 class="h3m">REASONS FOR CHOICE</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">among the several possible methods of
attaining the <span class="smmaj">OBJECTS.</span></p>

<p>Other things being equal, choose that entry</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) That will probably be first looked under by the class
of people who use the library;</li>

<li>(2) That is consistent with other entries, so that one
principle can cover all;</li>

<li>(3) That will mass entries least in places where it is
difficult to so arrange them that they can be readily
found, as under names of nations and cities.</li></ul>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>This applies very slightly to entries under first words,
because it is easy and sufficient to arrange them by the
alphabet.</p></div>

<h3 class="h3m">DEFINITIONS.</h3>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>There is such confusion in the use of terms in the various
prefaces to catalogues—a confusion that at once springs
from and leads to confusion of thought and practice—that it
is worth while to propose a systematic nomenclature.</p></div>

<p>Strictly a book is not anonymous if the author’s name

<p>Note that the words are “in the title,” not “on the
title-page.” Sometimes in Government publications the
author’s name and the title of his work do not appear on
the title-page but on a page immediately following. Such
works are not anonymous.</p></div>

in the narrower sense, is the person who writes
a book; in a wider sense it may be applied to him who is
the cause of the book’s existence by putting together the
writings of several authors (usually called <i>the</i> <i>editor</i>,
more properly to be called <i>the</i> <i>collector</i>). Bodies of men
(societies, cities, legislative bodies, countries) are to
be considered the authors of their memoirs, transactions,
journals, debates, reports, etc.</div>

<div class="ddefn">
<h4 class="h4defn" title="Class">Class,</h4>
a collection of objects having characteristics in
common.</div>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Books are classified by bringing together those which have
the same characteristics.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">[6]</a>
Of course any characteristics
might be taken, as size, or binding, or publisher. But as
nobody wants to know what books there are in the library
in folio, or what quartos, or what books bound in russia
or calf, or what published by John Smith, or by Brown,
Jones, and Robinson, these bases of classification are
left to the booksellers and auctioneers and trade sales.
Still, in case of certain unusual or noted bindings, as
human skin or Grolier’s, or early or famous publishers,
as Aldus and Elzevir, a partial class-list is sometimes
very properly made. But books are most commonly brought
together in catalogues because they have the same authors,
or the same subjects, or the same literary form, or are
written in the same language, or were given by the same
donor, or are designed for the same class of readers. When
brought together because they are by the same author, they
are not usually thought of as classified; they form the
author-catalogue, and need no further mention here except
in regard to arrangement. The classes, <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, in this
case the authors, might of course be further classified
according to their nations, or their professions (as the
subjects are in national or professional biographies), or
by any other set of common characteristics, but for library
purposes an alphabetical arrangement according to the
spelling of their names is universally acknowledged to be
the best.</p>

<p>The classification by language is not generally used
in full. There are catalogues in which all the English
books are separated from all the foreign; in others there
are separate lists of French books or German books. The
needs of each library must determine whether it is worth
while to prepare such lists. It is undeniably useful in
almost any library to make lists of the belles lettres
in the different languages; which, though nominally a
classification by language, is really a classification by
literary form, the object being to bring together all the
works with a certain national flavor—the French flavor,
the German flavor, or it may be a classing by readers,
the German books being catalogued together for a German
population, the French for the French, and so on. Again,
it is useful to give lists not of the belles lettres
alone, but of all the works in the rarer languages, as the
Bodleian and the British Museum have published separate
lists of their Hebrew books. Here too the circumstances of
each library must determine where it shall draw the line
between those literatures which it will put by themselves
and those which it will include and hide in the mass of
its general catalogue. Note, however, that some of the
difficulties of transliterating
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span> names of modern
Greek, Russian authors, etc., are removed by putting their
original works in a separate catalogue, though translations
still remain to puzzle us.</p>

<p>The catalogue by donors or original owners is usually
partial (as those of the Dowse, Barton, Prince, and Ticknor
libraries). The catalogues by classes of readers are also
partial, hardly extending beyond <em class="embold">Juvenile literature</em>
and <em class="embold">Sunday-school books.</em> Of course many subject
classes amount to the same thing, the class <em class="embold">Medicine</em>
being especially useful to medical men, <em class="embold">Theology</em> to
the theologians, and so on.</p>

<p>Classification by subject and classification by form are
the most common. An example will best show the distinction
between them. <em class="embold">Theology</em>, which is itself a subject,
is also a class, that is, it is extensive enough to
have its parts, its chapters, so to speak (as <em class="embold">Future Life</em>, <em class="embold">Holy Spirit</em>, <em class="embold">Regeneration</em>,
<em class="embold">Sin</em>, <em class="embold">Trinity</em>), treated separately, each when
so treated (whether in books or only in thought) being
itself a subject; all these together, inasmuch as they
possess this in common, that they have to do with some
part of the relations of God to man, form the class of
subjects <em class="embold">Theology.</em> Class, however, is applied to
<em class="embold">Poetry</em> in a different sense. It then signifies not a
collection of similar subjects, but a collection of books
resembling one another in being composed in that form and
with that spirit, whatever it is, which is called poetical.
In the subject-catalogue class it is used in the first
sense—collection of similar subjects; in the form-catalogue
it is used in the second—list of similar books.</p>

<p>Most systems of classification are mixed, as the following
analysis of one in actual use in a small library will show:</p>

<table class="fsz6" summary="">

</table>

<p>Confining ourselves now to classification by subjects, the
word can be used in three senses:</p>

<p class="phanga padtopc"><span class="p10outdent">1.</span>
Bringing books together which treat of the same subject
specifically.</p>

<p class="phangb">That is, books which each treat of the whole of the subject and
not of a part only.</p>

<p class="phanga"><span class="p10outdent">2.</span>
Bringing books together which treat of similar subjects.</p>

<p class="phangb">Or, to express the same thing differently:</p>

<p class="phanga"><span class="p10outdent">&#xa0;</span>
Bringing subjects together so as to form a class.</p>

<p class="phangb">A catalogue so made is called a classed catalogue.</p>

<p class="phanga"><span class="p10outdent">3.</span>
Bringing classes together so as to form a system.</p>

<p class="phangb">A catalogue so made should be called a systematic catalogue.</p>

<p class=" padtopc">The three steps are then</p>

<ul class="padtopc">
<li>1. Classifying the books to make subject-lists.</li>
<li>2. Classifying the subject-lists to make classes.</li>
<li>3. Classifying the classes to make a systematic catalogue.</li></ul>

<p class="padtopc">The dictionary stops in its entries at the first stage, in
its cross-references at the second.</p>

<p>The alphabetico-classed catalogue stops at the second stage.</p>

<p>The systematic alone advances to the third.</p>

<p>Classification in the first sense, it is plain, is
the same as “entry;” in the second <span class="xxpn"
id="p011">{11}</span> sense it is the same as
“class-entry;” and in the third sense it is the same
as the “logical arrangement” of the table on p.
<a href="#p012" title="to &#x70;age 12">12</a>,
under “Classed catalogue.”</p>

<p>It is worth while to ascertain the relation of
subject and class in the subject-catalogue. <i>Subject</i>
is the matter on which the author is seeking to give
or the reader to obtain information; <i>Class</i> is,
as said above, a grouping of subjects which have
characteristics in common. A little reflection will
show that the words so used partially overlap,&#x2009;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">[7]</a> the
general subjects being classes&#x2009;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">[8]</a> and the classes
being subjects,&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9"
id="fnanc9">[9]</a> but the individual subjects&#x2009;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">[10]</a> never
being classes.</p>

The subjects <em class="embold">Animals</em>, <em class="embold">Horses</em>,
<em class="embold">Plants</em> are classes, a fact which is perhaps more
evident to the eye if we use the terms <em class="embold">Zoology</em>,
<em class="embold">Hippology</em>, <em class="embold">Botany.</em> The subdivisions of
<em class="embold">Botany</em> and <em class="embold">Zoology</em> are obvious enough; the
subdivisions of <em class="embold">Hippology</em> may be themselves classes,
as <em class="embold">Shetland
ponies</em>, <em class="embold">Arabian
coursers</em>,
<em class="embold">Barbs</em>, or individual horses, as <em class="embold">Lady
Suffolk</em>,
<em class="embold">Justin
Morgan.</em></p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc9"
id="fn9">[9]</a> Not merely the concrete classes,
<em class="embold">Natural
history</em>,
<em class="embold">Geography</em>,
<em class="embold">Herpetology</em>,
<em class="embold">History</em>, <em
class="embold">Ichthyology</em>, <em
class="embold">Mineralogy</em>, but the abstract
ones, <em class="embold">Mathematics</em>, <em
class="embold">Philosophy</em>, are plainly subjects.
The fact that some books treat of the subject
Philosophy and others of philosophical subjects, and
that others treat in a philosophical manner subjects
not usually considered philosophical, introduces
confusion into the matter, and single examples may be
brought up in which it seems as if the classification
expressed the form (Crestadoro’s “nature”) or
something which a friend calls the “essence” of the
book and not its subject, so that we ought to speak
of an “essence catalogue” which might require some
special treatment; but the distinction can not be
maintained. It might be said, for example, that
“Geology a proof of revelation” would have for its
<i>subject-matter</i> <em class="embold">Geology</em> but
for its <i>class</i> <em class="embold">Theology</em>—which
is true, not because class and subject are
incompatible but because this book has two subjects,
the first <em class="embold">Geology</em>, the second
one of the evidences of revealed religion, wherefore,
as the <em class="embold">Evidences</em> are a
subdivision of <em class="embold">Theology</em>, the
book belongs under that as a subject-class.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc10" id="fn10">[10]</a>
It is plain enough that <em class="embold">Mt.
Jefferson</em>,
<em class="embold">John
Milton</em>, the <em class="embold">Warrior
Iron-clad</em> are not
classes. Countries, however, which for most purposes it
is convenient to consider as individual, are in certain
aspects classes; when by the word “England” we mean “the
English” it is the name of a class.</p></div></div><!--ddetaila-->

<p>A dictionary catalogue
contains class-headings, inasmuch as it contains
the headings of extensive subjects, but under them
there is no class entry, only specific entry. The
syndetic dictionary catalogue, however, recognizes
their nature by its cross-references, which constitute
it in a certain degree an alphabetico-classed (not
a systematic) catalogue. Moreover, the dictionary
catalogue, without ceasing to be one, might, if it
were thought worth while (which it certainly is
not), not merely give titles under specific headings
but repeat them under certain classes or under all
classes in ascending series, <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, not merely
have such headings as <em class="embold">Rose</em>,

alphabetical order.</div>

<div class="ddefn">
<h4 class="h4defn">Dictionary and other alphabetical

These are differentiated not, as is
often said, by the dictionary having specific entry,
but (1) by its giving specific entries in all cases
and (2) by its individual entry.</div>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Even the classed catalogues often have specific
entry. Whenever a book treats of the whole subject
of a class, it is specifically entered under that
class. A theological encyclopædia is specifically
entered under <em class="embold">Theology</em>, and
theology is an unsubordinated class in many systems.
The alphabetico-classed catalogues have specific
entry in many more cases, because they have many more
classes. Professor Abbot has such headings as <em
class="embold">Ink</em>, <em class="embold">Jute</em>,
<em class="embold">Lace</em>, <em
class="embold">Leather</em>, <em

class="embold">Vitriol.</em> Mr. Noyes has scores
of similar headings; but neither of them permits
individual entry, which the dictionary-catalogue
requires. The alphabetico-classed catalogue enters
a life of Napoleon and a history of England
under <em class="embold">Biography</em> and <em
class="embold">History</em>; the dictionary enters
them under <em class="embold">Napoleon</em> and <em

<em class="embold">Encyclopædias</em>, <em class="embold">Gazetteers</em>, <em class="embold">Indexes</em>,

<h4 class="h4defn" title="Reference">Reference,</h4>
partial registry of a book (omitting the

used to denote merely entries without imprints, in which
the reference is implied. The distinction of entry and

<p><i>E.</i> <i>g.</i>, registering “The art of painting” under

<em class="embold">Cactus.</em> Putting them under <em class="embold">Fine

the individual, as <em class="embold">Goethe</em>, <em class="embold">Shakespeare</em>,

Ages</em>, the ship
<em class="embold">Alexandra</em>, the dog <em class="embold">Tray</em>, the <em class="embold">French

general, as <em class="embold">Man</em>, <em class="embold">History</em>, <em class="embold">Horse</em>,
<em class="embold">Philosophy</em>, which may be either concrete or
abstract. Every general subject is a class more or less
extensive. (See note on <i>Class.</i>) Some mistakes have also
arisen from not noting that certain words, <em class="embold">Poetry</em>,
<em class="embold">Fiction</em>, <em class="embold">Drama</em>, etc., are subject-headings
for the books written about Poetry, Fiction, etc., and
form-headings for poems, novels, plays, etc.</p></div>

<h4 class="h4defn" title="Subject-entry">Subject-entry,</h4>
<i>Subject-word</i> <i>entry.</i> See <i>Entry.</i></div>

<div class="ddefn">
<h4 class="h4defn" title="Syndetic">Syndetic,</h4>
connective, applied to that kind of dictionary
catalogue which binds its entries together by means of
cross-references so as to form a whole, the references
being made from the most comprehensive subject to those
of the next lower degree of comprehensiveness, and from
each of these to their subordinate subjects, and vice
versa. These cross-references correspond to and are a good
substitute for the arrangement in a systematic catalogue.
References are also made in the syndetic catalogue to
illustrative and coördinate subjects, and, if it is
perfect, from specific to general subjects.</div>

<div class="ddefn">
<h4 class="h4defn">Title</h4>
in the broader sense includes heading, title
proper, and imprint; in the narrower (in which it is
hereafter used) it is the name of the book given by the
author on the title-page, omitting the imprint, but
including names of editors, translators, etc. The name
of the book put on the leaf preceding the title page is
called the <i>half-title</i>; and the same term is applied to
lines indicating subdivisions of the book and following the
title; the name given at the head of the first page of text
is the <i>caption.</i> That given at the back of the book (the
<i>binder’s</i> <i>title</i>) should never be used in a catalogue which
makes the slightest pretensions to carefulness.</div>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>A title may be either the book’s name (as “&amp;c.”) or its
description (as “A collection of occasional sermons”), or
it may state its subject (as “Synonyms of the New <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
Testament”), or it may be any two or all three of these
combined (as description and subject, “Brief account of
a journey through Europe;” name and description, “Happy
thoughts;” name and subject, “Men’s wives;” all three,
“Index of dates”).</p>

<p>Bibliographers have established a cult of the title-page;
its slightest peculiarities are noted; it is followed
religiously, with dots for omissions, brackets for
insertions, and uprights to mark the end of lines; it
is even imitated by the fac-simile type or photographic
copying. These things may concern the cataloguer of the
Lenox Library or the Prince collection. The ordinary
librarian has in general nothing to do with them; but it
does not follow that even he is to lose all respect for
the title. It is the book’s name and should not be changed
but by act of legislature. Our necessities oblige us to
abbreviate it, but nothing obliges us to make additions to
it or to change it without giving notice to the reader that
we have done so. Moreover, it must influence the entry of a
book more or less; it determines the title-entry entirely;
it affects the author-entry (see §
<a href="#a7-003" title="to &#xa7; 3">3</a>) and the subject-entry
(see § <a href="#a7-104" title="to &#xa7; 104">104</a>).
But to let it have more power than this is to
pay it a superstitious veneration.</p></div>

<div class="ddefn">
<h4 class="h4defn" title="Volume">Volume,</h4>
a book distinguished
from other books or other volumes of the same work by
having its own title, paging, and register.</div>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>This is the bibliographic use of the word, sanctioned by
the British Museum rules. That is, it is in this sense
only that it applies to all the copies of an edition as it
comes from the printer. But there is also a bibliopegic
and bibliopolic use, to denote a number of pages bound
together, which pages may be several volumes in the other
sense, or a part of a volume or parts of several volumes.
To avoid confusion I use “volume” in the present treatise
as defined in the Rules of the British Museum catalogue,
and I recommend this as the sole use in library catalogues,
except in such phrases as 2 v. bd. in 1. which means 2
volumes in the bibliographical sense united by binding so
as to form one piece of matter.</p></div>

<hr class="hr10" />

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In the present treatise I am
regarding the dictionary catalogue as consisting of an
author-catalogue, a subject-catalogue, a more or less
complete title-catalogue, and a more or less complete
form-catalogue, all interwoven in one alphabetical
order. The greater part, however, of the rules here
given would apply equally to these catalogues when
kept separate.</p>

<p>These rules are written primarily for a printed
catalogue; almost all of them would apply equally to a
card catalogue.</p></div></div><!--section-->

<p>When countries are joint authors it is better to make full
entries under each and arrange them as if the country under
consideration were the only one. Each country puts its own
name first in its own edition of a joint work; and the
arrangement proposed avoids an additional complexity under
countries, which are confusing enough at the best.</p>

<p>Whether the joint authorship appears in the title or not
should make no difference in the mode of entry; if one name
appears on the title, that should be chosen for the entry;
if none, take the most important.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-004" class="spa7">4</span>.
When double headings are used distinguish between joint
authors of one work and two authors of separate works
joined in one volume. In the latter case, if there is no
collective title, the heading should be the name of the
first author alone and an analytical reference should be
made from the second. (See § <a href="#a7-058" title="to &#xa7; 58">58</a> <i>b.</i>)</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> “The works of Shelley and Keats” would be entered
in full under <em class="embold">Shelley</em> (both names being mentioned
in the title, but Shelley alone in the heading), and
analytically (§ <a href="#a7-127" title="to &#xa7; 127">127</a>) under <em class="embold">Keats.</em> In such cases a
double heading would often mislead.</p></div>

For university theses or dissertations Dziatzko gives

(“auctor et respondens,” “scriptor,” etc.) enter under the

<li><i>b</i> If the respondent is “auctor” enter under him, with
reference from the præses.</li></ul></li>

<li>II. After 1750 enter under the respondent, unless it is
known that the præses is the author, when his name will be
the heading. In neither case refer from the other name.</li></ul>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>For universities where the old custom was kept up beyond
1750, as the Swedish, Rule I applies till the change was
made. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span> </p>

<p>Where there are two respondents, neither specified as
author, enter under the first, without reference from the
second.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-006" class="spa7">6</span>.
Enter pseudonymous works generally under the author’s
real name, when it is known, with a reference from the
pseudonym; but make the entry under the pseudonym, with a
reference from the real name, when the writer is better
known by the false name.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In the first edition this rule was without limitation,
and I added the following note “One is strongly tempted
to deviate from this rule in the case of writers like
George Eliot and George Sand, Gavarni and Grandville, who
appear in literature only under their pseudonyms. It would
apparently be much more convenient to enter their works
under the name by which alone they are known and under
which everybody but a professed cataloguer would assuredly
look first. For an author-catalogue this might be the best
plan, but in a dictionary catalogue we have to deal with
such people not merely as writers of books, but as subjects
of biographies or parties in trials, and in such cases it
seems proper to use their legal names. Besides, if one
attempts to exempt a few noted writers from the rule given
above, where is the line to be drawn? No definite principle
of exception can be laid down which will guide either the
cataloguer or the reader; and probably the confusion would
in the end produce greater inconvenience than the present
rule. Moreover, the entries made by using the pseudonym as
a heading would often have to be altered. For a long time
it would have been proper to enter the works of Dickens
under <em class="embold">Boz</em>; the Dutch annual bibliography uniformly
uses Boz-Dickens as a heading. No one would think of
looking under <em class="embold">Boz</em> now. Mark Twain is in a transition
state. The public mind is divided between Twain and
Clemens. The tendency is always toward the use of the real
name; and that tendency will be much helped in the reading
public if the real name is always preferred in catalogues.
Some pseudonyms persistently adopted by authors have come
to be considered as the only names, as <em class="embold">Voltaire</em> (see
§ <a href="#a7-023" title="to &#xa7; 23">23</a>), and the translation <em class="embold">Melanchthon.</em> Perhaps
George <em class="embold">Sand</em> and George <em class="embold">Eliot</em> will in time be
adjudged to belong to the same company. It would be well
if cataloguers could appoint some permanent committee with
authority to decide this and similar points as from time to
time they occur.”</p>

<p>I am now in favor of frequent entry under the pseudonym,
with reference from the real name. I should recommend the
pseudonym as heading in the case of any popular writer who
has not written under his own name, provided he is known
to the public chiefly by his pseudonym, and in the subject
catalogue for any person who is so known. Examples are
George <em class="embold">Eliot</em>, George <em class="embold">Sand</em>, <em class="embold">Gavarni</em>,
<em class="embold">Grandville</em>, <em class="embold">Cagliostro</em>, <em class="embold">Cham</em>, Pierre
<em class="embold">Loti</em>, Daniel <em class="embold">Stern</em>, in some doubtful cases a
card catalogue might profitably make entry both under the
real and the false name. This elastic practice will give
a little more trouble to the cataloguer than a rigid rule
of entry under the real name, but it will save trouble to
those who use the catalogue, which is more important.</p>

<p>But entry should not be made under a pseudonym which is
used only once or a few times; if the author writes also
under his real name, if he is known to the contemporary
public or in literary history under his real name, that
is to be used for entry. It may sometimes happen that an
author is well known under a pseudonym and afterwards is
better known by his real name. In that case change the
entries from the false to the real name. If any author uses
two different pseudonyms enter under each the works written
under it, with references both ways, and from the real
name, until the real name becomes better known.</p>

<p>It is plain that this practice of entering under the
<i>best</i> <i>known</i> name, whether real or false, puts an end to
uniformity of entry between different catalogues, leads
to inconsistency of entry in the same catalogue, and will
often throw the cataloguer into perplexity to decide which
name is best known; but for the last objection it must
be remembered that the catalogue is made for the reader,
not for the cataloguer, and <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span> for the first two that
references will prevent any serious difficulty; and in the
few cases of nearly equal notoriety, double entry is an
easy way out of the difficulty.</p></div>

<span id="a7-007" class="spa7">7</span>.
When the illustrations form a very important part of
a work, consider both the author of the text and the
designer—or in certain cases the engraver—of the plates
to be author, and make a full entry under each. Under the
author mention the designer’s name in the title, and vice
versa.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Such works are: Walton’s Welsh scenery, with text by
Bonney; Wolf’s “Wild animals,” with text by Elliot.
Which shall be taken as author in the subject or form
entry depends upon the work and the subject. Under
<em class="embold">Water-color
drawings</em> it would be Walton; under
<em class="embold">Wood-engravings</em>, Wolf; under <em class="embold">Wales</em> and
<em class="embold">Zoölogy</em>, the cataloguer must decide which
illustrates the subject most, the writer or the artist. <i>E.
g.</i>, under <em class="embold">Gothic
Architecture</em> Pugin is undoubtedly
to be considered the author of his “Examples,” though “the
literary part” is by E. J. Willson; for the illustrator
was really the author and the text was subsidiary to the
plates. It was to carry out Pugin’s ideas, not Willson’s,
that the work was published.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-008" class="spa7">8</span>.
The designer or painter copied is the author of
engravings; the cartographer is the author of maps; the
engraver in general is to be considered as no more the
author than the printer. But in a special catalogue of
engravings the engraver would be considered as author; in
any full catalogue references should be made from the names
of famous engravers, as Raimondi, Müller, Steinla, Wolle.

heavier type than the rest.</p>

<p>In Arabic names the words of relationship Abu (father),
Umm (mother), Ibn, Bin (son), Ahu (brother), though not
to be treated as names by themselves, are yet not to be
disregarded, as proposed by Dr. Dziatzko. They form a name
in conjunction with the word following (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, <em class="embold">Abu
Bakr</em>) and determine the alphabetical place of the
entry. But the article al (changed by assonance to ad-,
ar-, as-, at-, az-, according to the letter it precedes) is
neglected (al-<em class="embold">Masudi</em>).</p>

<p>In all Oriental names the cataloguer must be careful not to
take titles, as Emir, Bey, Pasha, Sri, Babu, Pundit, for
names.</p>

<p>In regard to East Indian names, Dr. Feigl (Centralbl. f.
Bibl., 4: 120) gives the rule: If there are two names,
enter under the first, which is the individual name, with a
reference from the second; if there are three, enter under
the third, which is the family name, with a reference under
the second.</p></div>

<p>The direction “Use the English form of the
name” was a concession to ignorance; when it was
given, that form was almost alone employed in
English books; since then the tone of literature
has changed; the desire for local coloring has led
to the use of foreign forms, and we have become
familiarized with Louis, Henri, Marguerite, Carlos,
Karl, Wilhelm, Gustaf. If the present tendency
continues we shall be able to treat princes’ names
like any other foreign names; perhaps the next
generation of cataloguers will no more tolerate
the headings <em class="embold">William</em>
<i>Emperor of</i> <i>Germany</i>, <em class="embold">Lewis</em>
<span class="smmaj">XIV</span> than they will
tolerate <em class="embold">Virgil</em>,

would give rise to some difficult questions of
nationality, but it would diminish the number of the

The British Museum and Mr. Jewett enter
British noblemen under the family name; Mr. Perkins prefers
entry under titles for British noblemen, in which I agree
with him, although the opposite practice is now so well
established. The reasons for entry under the title are
that British noblemen are always so spoken of, always
sign by their titles only, and seldom put the family name
upon the title-pages of their books, so that ninety-nine
in a hundred readers must look under the title first.
The reasons against it are that the founders of noble
families are often as well known—sometimes even better—by
their family name as by their titles (as Charles Jenkinson
afterwards Lord Liverpool, Sir Robert Walpole afterwards
Earl of Orford); that the same man bears different titles
in different parts of his life (thus P. Stanhope published
his “History of England from the peace of Utrecht” as Lord
Mahon, and his “Reign of Queen Anne” as Earl Stanhope);
that it separates members of the same family (Lord
Chancellor Eldon would be under <em class="embold">Eldon</em> and his father
and all his brothers and sisters under the family name
<em class="embold">Scott</em>), and brings together members of different
families (thus the earldom of Bath has been held by members
of the families of Shaunde, Bourchier, Granville, and
Pulteney, and the family name of the present Marquis of
Bath is Thymne), which last argument would be more to the
point in planning a family history. The same objections
apply to the entry of French noblemen under their titles,
about which there can be no hesitation. The strongest
argument in favor of the Museum rule is that it is
well-established and that it is desirable that there should
be some uniform rule. Ecclesiastical dignitaries stand on
an entirely different footing. There is much more use of
the family name and much more change of title. In the first
edition I followed the British Museum rules, but I am now
in favor of the more popular method of entry of noblemen,
namely, under their titles, <i>except when the family name
is decidedly better</i> <i>known</i> (Francis <em class="embold">Bacon</em>, <i>Baron
Verulam</i>, Horace <em class="embold">Walpole</em>, <i>4th Earl of</i> <i>Orford</i>).
In such cases enter under the family name and refer from
the title. This rule was adopted by the committee of the
American Library Association (<i>Lib.</i> <i>jnl.</i>, 3: 12–19; 8:
251–254). The reasons pro and con were discussed in <i>Lib.
jnl.</i>, 3: 13, 14. The gist of them is: “Authors should be
put under their names. The definition of a name is ‘that
by which a person or thing is known.’ British noblemen are
known by their titles, not by their family names.”</p>

to determine what is a compound surname in French. A
convenient rule would be to follow the authority of Hœfer

agreed; unfortunately, they often differ. References are

The vernacular form of most Christian names
may be found in Michaelis’s “Wörterbuch der Taufnamen”
(Berlin, 1856). There are also meagre lists in foreign
dictionaries. For the forms of mediæval names much
assistance can be had from A. Potthast’s “Bibliotheca
historica medii aevi, Berlin, Weber, 1862,” O, and
“Supplement, 1868,” O; also from Alfred Franklin’s
“Dictionnaire des noms, surnoms, et pseudonymes latins de
l’histoire littéraire du Moyen Age (1100 à 1530), Paris,
1876,” O. (On the names of sovereigns, see § <a href="#a7-019" title="to &#xa7; 19">19</a>; on the

This is the British Museum rule. It will
obviously be sometimes impossible and often difficult to
determine this point in a library of less extent than the
Museum, and the cataloguer must make up his mind to some
inconsistency in his treatment of mediæval names, and be
consoled by the knowledge that if proper references are
made no harm will be done. Against a too great preference
for the vernacular Professor De Morgan writes in the
preface to his “Arithmetical books:” “I have not attempted
to translate the names of those who wrote in Latin at
a time when that language was the universal medium of
communication. I consider that the Latin name is that
which the author has left to posterity, and that the
practice of retaining it is convenient, as marking, to a
certain extent, the epoch of his writings, and as being
the appellation by which his contemporaries and successors
cite him. It is well to know that Copernicus, Dasypodius,
Xylander, Regiomontanus, and Clavius were Zepernik,
Rauchfuss, Holtzmann, Müller, and Schlüssel. But as the
butchers’ bills of these eminent men are all lost, and
their writings only remain, it is best to designate them by
the name they bear on the latter rather than the former.”</p>


<p>The same may be said of Camerarius (Kämmerer), Capito
(Kopflein), Mercator (Kramer), Œcolampadius (Hausschein),
where it would be useless to employ the vernacular name;
if both forms are in use, as in the case of Pomeranius
=&nbsp;Bugenhagen, the vernacular should have the preference.
Reuchlin is much more common than its equivalent, Capnio.</p>


<p>Before the Reformation the presumption is in favor of the
Latin form; after it in favor of the vernacular.</p>


<p>Short will consult the convenience of his readers if
he uses the English forms of names like <em class="embold">Homer</em>,
<em class="embold">Horace</em>, <em class="embold">Virgil</em>, in place of <em class="embold">Homerus</em>,
<em class="embold">Horatius</em>, <em class="embold">Vergilius.</em></p>


<p>The vernacular names of the Middle Ages often appear in
various forms. The form which has survived to the present
time is to be preferred (as <em class="embold">Jean</em> to <em class="embold">Jehan</em>),
unless a name is commonly used in the old form, as in the
romances <em class="embold">Jehan</em> de Lançon. Refer from the one not
chosen.</p></div>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Of course, great care must be taken not to enter separately
works in which an author spells his name differently, as
Briant and Bryant, Easterbrookes and Estabrook, Erdmann and
Erdtmann. On the other hand, different people who spell
their names differently should be separated, as Hofmann and
Hoffmann, Maier, Mair, Majer, Mayer, Mayr, Meier, Meir,
Mejer, Meyer, Meyr, Schmid, Schmidt, Schmied, Schmiedt,
Schmit, Schmitt. (On the arrangement of such names in a
card catalogue see § <a href="#a7-218" title="to &#xa7; 218">218</a>.)</p>

<p>In German Christian names there is a want of uniformity in
the use of C and K (Carl, Conrad, Karl, Konrad) and f and
ph (Adolf, Adolph). Occasionally an author uses both forms
in different books, or writing only in Latin (Carolus,
Rudolphus), does not show which form he prefers. Where the
author thus leaves the point undecided, K and f should be
preferred to C and ph (except in Christoph). Swedish f is
to be preferred to v, as Gustaf, not Gustav.</p></div>

In transliteration of names from alphabets
of differently formed letters, use the vowels
according to their German sounds. (<i>See</i> Appendix
<span class="smmaj">II</span> for the report of the
Transliteration Committee of the American Library
Association.)</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>I.</i> <i>e.</i>, <em class="embold">a</em> (not <i>ah</i>) for the sound of <i>a</i> in
<i>father</i>, <em class="embold">e</em> (not <i>a</i>) for the sound of <i>e</i> in <i>heir</i>
or of <i>a</i> in <i>hate</i>, <em class="embold">i</em> (not <i>e</i>) for the sound of
<i>i</i> in <i>mien</i>, <em class="embold">u</em> (not <i>oo</i> nor <i>ou</i>) for the sound
of <i>u</i> in <i>true</i> or of <i>oo</i> in <i>moon.</i> This practice makes
transliterations that are likely to be pronounced in the
main correctly by anyone who knows any language but his own
(who would naturally give foreign vowel sounds to foreign
names), and will give transliterations agreeing at least in
part with those of other nations. In some points, however,
we must be careful not to be misled by the practice of
foreigners, and when we take a name from Russian, for
instance, through the French or German, must see to it
that the necessities of their alphabet have not led them
to use letters that do not suit our system. A Frenchman
writes for Turgenief <i>Tourguénef</i>, and for Golovin <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
<i>Golovine</i>, and uses <i>ou</i> for <i>u</i>, <i>ch</i> for <i>sh</i>, <i>dj</i> for
<i>j</i>, <i>j</i> for <i>zh</i>, <i>gu</i> for <i>g</i>, and <i>qu</i> for <i>k.</i> A German
for Dershavin writes <i>Derschawin</i>, and, worse than that,
is obliged to use the clumsy <i>dsch</i> where an Englishman
can use j, as <i>Dschellaleddin</i> for Jalal-ad-Din, and uses
<i>tsch</i> for <i>ch</i> or <i>tch</i>, <i>j</i> for <i>y</i> or <i>i</i> (Turgenjew),
<i>w</i> for <i>v</i> or <i>f</i> in the ending of Russian names.</p>

<p>In <i>Arabic</i> names I am advised by good scholars to
uniformly write <em class="embold">a</em> where our ordinary Anglicized
names have <em class="embold">e</em>, except for Ebn and Ben, which become
Ibn and Bin; also <em class="embold">i</em> for <em class="embold">ee</em>, and <em class="embold">u</em>
where <em class="embold">o</em> has been commonly used; in other words, to
uniformly represent the vowel fatha by <em class="embold">a</em>, kasra by
<em class="embold">i</em>, and dhamma by <em class="embold">u.</em> Thus <em class="embold">Mohammed</em>
becomes <em class="embold">Muhammad</em>, <em class="embold">Abou
ed-Deen</em> becomes
<em class="embold">Abu
ad-Din.</em> Of course references must be made from
the corrupt forms under which various Arabic authors have
become known in the West, unless it is thought that the
altered form has been so commonly used that it must be
taken for the entry, as perhaps <em class="embold">Avicenna</em> from Ibn
Sina, <em class="embold">Averroes</em> from Ibn Roshd.</p>

<p>In <i>Danish</i> names if the type <em class="embold">å</em> is not to be had,
use its older equivalent <em class="embold">aa</em>; in a manuscript
catalogue the modern orthography, <em class="embold">å</em>, should be
employed. Whichever is chosen should be uniformly used,
however the names may appear in the books. The diphthong
<em class="embold">æ</em> should not be written <em class="embold">ae</em>, nor should
<em class="embold">ö</em> be written <em class="embold">oe</em>; <em class="embold">ö</em>, not <em class="embold">œ</em>,
should be used for <em class="embold">ø.</em></p>

<p>In old <i>Dutch</i> names write <em
class="embold">y</em> for the modern <em
class="embold">ij</em> and arrange so.</p>

<p>In <i>German</i> names used as headings, use <em
class="embold">ä</em>, <em class="embold">ö</em>, <em
class="embold">ü</em>, not <em class="embold">ae</em>,
<em class="embold">oe</em>, <em
class="embold">ue</em>, and arrange accordingly.</p>

<p>For <i>ancient</i> <i>Greek</i> names use the Latinized form, as
<em class="embold">Democritus</em> not <em class="embold">Demokritos</em>, <em class="embold">Longinus</em>
not <em class="embold">Logginos.</em> This holds good of translated works
as well as of the originals. It will not do to enter
an Italian version of the Odyssey under <em class="embold">Omero</em>,
or of the Euterpe under <em class="embold">Erodoto</em>, or a French
version of the Noctes Atticæ under <em class="embold">Aulu-Gelle.</em>
A college literary catalogue may safely use the more
nearly transliterated forms which are coming into use,
like <em class="embold">Aiskulos</em>, <em class="embold">Homeros</em>, but used in a
town-library catalogue they would only puzzle and mislead
its readers. For that I should prefer the English forms, as
<em class="embold">Homer</em>, <em class="embold">Horace.</em></p>

<p>For <i>modern</i> <i>Greek</i> names Professor Abbot proposes the
following plan: Works in Romaic to be entered in a
supplement, the names not transliterated but printed in the
Greek type. Translations of works of modern Greek authors
to be put under their Greek names in the supplement, with
references in the main catalogue under the forms (whatever
they may be) which their names assume in the translation.
Original works written in French, German, English, etc.,
by modern Greek authors may be treated in the same way if
their authors have not become French, German, or English by
residence and literary labors, in which case they should be
entered under the French, German, or English forms which
they have chosen for their names, with cross-references, if
necessary, from the Greek supplement to these names. If,
however, transliteration is attempted the following table
of equivalents may be used:</p>

as a series of experiments. No satisfactory usage has as
yet been established. Local names have always very strong
claims to be headings; but to enter the publications of all
bodies of men under the places with which the bodies are

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>The chief practices in regard to societies have been
to enter them (1. British Museum) under a special
heading—<em class="embold">Academies</em>—with a geographical arrangement;
(2. Boston Public Library, printed catalogue) under the
name of the place where they have their headquarters;
(3. Harvard College Library and Bost. Pub. Lib., present
system) under the name of the place, <i>if it enters into
the legal name of the</i> <i>society</i>, otherwise under the first
word of that name not an article; (4. Boston Athenæum)
English societies under the first word of the society’s
name not an article, foreign societies under the name of
the place. Both 3 and 4 put under the place all purely
local societies, those whose membership or objects are
confined to the place. The 1st does not deserve a moment’s
consideration; such a heading is out of place in an
author-catalogue, and the geographical arrangement only
serves to complicate matters and render it more difficult
to find any particular academy.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanc27">[27]</a>
The 2d is utterly
unsuited to American and English societies. The 3d practice
is simple; but it is difficult to see the advantage of
the exception which it makes to its general rule of entry
under the society’s name; the exception does not help the
cataloguer, for it is just as hard to determine whether the
place enters into the <i>legal</i> name as it is to ascertain
the name; it does not help the reader, for he has no means
of knowing whether the place is part of the legal name or
not. The 4th is simple and intelligible; it is usually
easy for both cataloguer and reader to determine whether a
society is English or foreign. I shall mention two other
possible plans, well aware that there are strong objections
to both.</p>

<p>5<span class="smmaj">TH PLAN.</span> <i>Rule</i> 1. Enter
academies,&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">[28]</a>
associations, institutes, universities,
societies, libraries, galleries, museums, colleges, and all
similar bodies, and churches that <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span> have an individual
name, both English and foreign, according to their
corporate name, neglecting an initial article when there is
one.</p>

<p><i>Exception</i> 1. Enter the universities and the royal
academies of Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig, Lisbon, Madrid,
Munich, St. Petersburg, Vienna, etc., and the “Institut” of
Paris, under those cities. An exception is an evil. This
one is adopted because the universities and academies are
almost universally known by the names of the cities, and
are hardly ever referred to by the name Königliche, Real,
etc.</p>

<p><i>Exception</i> 2. Enter London guilds under the name of the
trade; <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, “<em class="embold">Stationers’
Company</em>,” not “Master
and Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery and
Art of Stationers of the City of London,” which is the
corporate title. This exception is adopted because (1)
it gives a heading easier to find, and (2) it would be
difficult in many cases to ascertain the real names of the
London companies.</p>

<p><i>Exception</i> 3. Enter bodies whose legal name begins with
such words as Board, Corporation, Trustees under that part
of the name by which they are usually known.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> <i>g.</i> Trustees of the <em class="embold">Eastern</em>
<span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">Dispensary.</em>
Corporation</span> of the <em class="embold">Chamber of
Commerce</em> in the City
of New <span class="wdspa">York. Proprietors</span> of the <em class="embold">Boston</em>
<span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">Athenæum.</em>
Contributors</span> to the <em class="embold">Asylum for the Relief of Persons
deprived of
their</em> <span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">Reason.</em> Refer</span> from the first word of
the legal name.</p>

<p><i>Exception</i> 4. Enter orders of knighthood under the
significant word of the English title; as, <em class="embold">Garter,
Order of
the</em>; <em class="embold">Malta, Knights
of</em>; <em class="embold">Templars,
Knights</em>; <em class="embold">Teutonic
Order.</em></p>

<p><i>Exception</i> 5. Enter American State historical and
agricultural societies under the name of the State.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> 2. <i>a.</i> Enter churches which have no individual
name and all purely local benevolent or moral or similar
societies under the name of the place.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Young men’s Christian associations, mercantile library
associations, and the like are to be considered local.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Business firms or corporations (except national
banks numbered as First National Bank, etc.), libraries,
galleries, museums, are not to be considered local, nor
are private schools local, but go under their corporate
name, or, if they are not corporate, under the name of the
proprietor.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> National libraries museums, and galleries and
libraries, museums, and galleries instituted or supported
by a city go under the name of the city provided they
have not a name of their own. (<i>E.</i> <i>g.</i>, the <em class="embold">Boston</em>
<i>Public</i> <i>Library</i> goes under <em class="embold">Boston</em>; but the
<em class="embold">Reuben Hoar
Library</em> of Littleton goes under
<em class="embold">Hoar.</em>) American public schools should in any case go
under the name of the city. (Rule 2, <i>h.</i>)</p>

<p><i>e.</i> If college societies limited to one college are
considered local, they would be entered not under the name
of the place but of the college; if they are treated by
rule 1, as all general college societies must be, reference
(6) must be made. College libraries go under the name of
the college. The colleges of an English university and the
schools of an American university go under the name of the
university.</p>

<p class="spitalic">Refer</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) from all the varying forms of the society’s
name.</li>

<li>(2) from important words in the society’s name, when the
first word is unlikely to be thought of.</li>

<li>(3) from the name of the city where the society is situated.</li>

<li>(4) from the motto in the names of Dutch societies.</li>

<li>(5) from the names of the royal societies of Berlin, etc.</li>

<li>(6) from colleges to college societies.</li>

<li>(7) from such words as <em class="embold">Gallery</em>, <em class="embold">Museum</em>, etc.,
to all the galleries, museums, etc., contained in the
catalogue. <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></li></ul>

<p><i>f.</i> Universities, galleries, etc., called merely Imperial,
Royal, National and the like are not to be considered as
having individual names, except the <em class="embold">National
Gallery</em>
of London.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Buildings are for the most part provided for in the
above rules as museums, galleries, libraries, churches,
etc. Any others should be entered under their names, with a
reference from the city.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> If a firm’s name is in the form <em class="embold">Raphael Friedlander
und
Sohn</em> it might be put as it reads, <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, under R,
or reversed, <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, <em class="embold">Friedlander und Sohn,
Raphael.</em>
I prefer the latter, because the consulter is much more
likely to remember the family than the Christian name.
Whether the Christian name is written at the end or thus,
<em class="embold">Town (John) and Bowers
(Henry)</em>, all firms should be
arranged after all the other entries of the first family
name, <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, <em class="embold">Friedlander und
Sohn</em> after all the
<em class="embold">Friedlanders.</em> The same reason applies to other
bodies whose legal name begins with a forename.</p>

<h4 class="h4m">B. SUBSTITUTES.</h4>

<p>Substitutes for the author’s name (to be chosen in the
following order) <span class="nowrap">are—</span></p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-057" class="spa7">57</span>.
Part of the author’s name when only a part is known.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> For a book “by J. B. Far...,” or “by L.
M. P.,” or “by Ddg.,” or “by —lsd—,” the entry is
to be made under <em class="embold">Far...</em>,
J. B., <em class="embold">P.</em>, L.
M., <em class="embold">Ddg.</em>, <em
class="embold">—lsd—.</em> If the last initials are
evidently, from the style of printing, those of a
title, the entry will be under the initial preceding
them; thus for books “by B. F., <i>D.D.</i>,” or “by M.
P. R., <i>Gent.</i>,” or “by X. Y. Z., <i>D.D.</i>,” the entry
is to be made under <em class="embold">F.</em>,
B., <i>D.D.</i>, and <em class="embold">R.</em>, M. P.,
<i>Gent.</i>, and <em class="embold">Z.</em>, X. Y.,
<i>D.D.</i> In such case it is safest to have also a
reference from the last initial to the one chosen,
as <em class="embold">D.</em>, X. Y. Z. D. <i>See</i>
<em class="embold">Z.</em>, X. Y., <i>D.D.</i> It is
often well to make a reference from the first word
(title-reference). This mode of entry ensures the easy
finding of a particular book and brings together all
of an author’s works in which the same letters are
used, and sometimes leads to the discovery of a real
name.</p>

<p>Even mere printer’s marks, as *** or ..., or !!!,
unaccompanied by any letters, though they can not be
considered as names, may be used as headings for a
reference <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
for the sake of bringing together all the
works of an author using them; but each work should also
have title entry if anonymous.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-058" class="spa7">58</span>.
A pseudonym, that is, a false name; as, John
<em class="embold">Phenix,</em> Mark <em
class="embold">Twain.</em></p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>If the author’s real name is known, make the entry under
that, with a reference from the pseudonym; but if the
writer is much better known by the pseudonym, enter under
that, with a reference from the real name. (See note under
§ <a href="#a7-006" title="to &#xa7; 6">6</a>.)</p>

<p>A phrase—“One who loves his country,” “A friend to
peace”—or even a shorter appellation—“A lawyer”—is not
a name. References might be made from these to the word
under which the book is entered, but they would swell the
catalogue and rarely be of use. Appellatives beginning with
the definite article, like “The Prig,” “The Old Shekarry,”
“The Duchess,” are not vague like “A lover of justice,”
and when constantly used should be treated as names in
the way either of entry or reference. Latin phrases, like
“Amator patriæ,” should be treated as names and the entry
made under the last word; as, <em class="embold">Patriæ</em>, Amator. But
it should not be made under patronymic adjectives, or
certain words like junior, senior, evidently intended to
qualify the name, not to be taken as the name; <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>,
the heading for a book “by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis”
would not be <em class="embold">Lipsiensis</em>, Phileleutherus, but
<em class="embold">Phileleutherus</em> <i>Lipsiensis</i>; Vanity Fair Album
by Jehu Junior would go under <em class="embold">Jehu</em> <i>junior</i>, not
<em class="embold">Junior</em>, Jehu. In such cases a reference from
the word which is not taken as the heading will be an
additional safeguard.</p>

<p>Pseudonyms like Aunt Jane, Cousin Mary, Uncle John, should
be entered under the second word, although it is evidently
not a family name but a forename; it is all the name that
we have.</p>

<p>The word Anonymus may be considered as a pseudonym when
used as follows: “Anonymi introductio in,” etc.</p>

<p>A foreign article beginning a pseudonym used in an
English work is considered as a part of the name; as,
<em class="embold">El-Mukattem</em>, <i>pseud.</i></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-059" class="spa7">59</span>.
Collector.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>That is, the one who is responsible for the existence of
a collection. A collection is made by putting together,
with a collective title, three or more works by different
authors, so as to make one work.</p>

<p><i>Examples</i>: Johnson’s “Little classics,” Buchon’s
“Collection des mémoires.”</p></div>

<p class="pa7a"><i>a.</i> This rule does not apply to
the collector (editor) of a periodical. (§ <a
href="#a7-073" title="to &#xa7; 73">73</a>.)</p>

<p class="pa7a"><i>b.</i> Several works published together
without a collective title are to be put under that
author’s name which appears first on the title-page,
even though the collector’s name is also there; in
other words, he is then to be considered merely as
the editor. (See § <a href="#a7-004" title="to &#xa7;

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>If it is thought worth while to give a complete
view of the literary and artistic activity of every
author so far as it is represented in the library,
of course references from editors, translators,
illustrators, cartographers, engravers, etc., must be
made. But this completeness is not usually sought even
in large libraries. Such references <span class="xxpn"
id="p037">{37}</span> are also undeniably a help in
finding books. But they increase the bulk and the
cost of a catalogue so much and are comparatively of
so little use that ordinary libraries must content
themselves with a selection, though the best-made
selection is certain to occasion complaints that
the really useful ones have been omitted and the
least important made. The chief classes of necessary
references of this sort <span class="nowrap">are—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>(1.) From the editors of periodicals to the title-entry,
when the periodical is commonly called by the editor’s
name, as Poggendorff’s Annalen, Silliman’s Journal.</li>

<li>(2.) From the names of editors and translators which are
habitually mentioned in connection with a work, so that it
is as likely to be looked for under the editor’s name as
under the author’s name. When the form is a combination of
author’s and editor’s name, as Heyne’s Virgil, Leverett’s
Cicero, the reference, though convenient, is certainly not
necessary, inasmuch as a person of ordinary intelligence
could hardly fail, not finding what he wanted under one
name, to try the other.</li>

<li>(3.) From the names of those who have made poetical
versions, on the ground that their work is something more
than mere translation.</li>

<li>(4.) From the translators of anonymous works, because the
title of the original will generally be unknown to the
searcher. This is less necessary for famous works; thus J.
Scott’s version of the Arabian Nights would probably be
looked for under <em class="embold">Arabian</em> nights rather than under
<em class="embold">Scott</em>; but it makes assurance doubly sure.</li>

<li>(5.) From the names of translators, editors, etc., of
Oriental works, because Occidental readers are much more
likely to remember these names than those of the authors.</li></ul>

<p>It may be thought that an excessive number of references is
recommended, but it is plain that wherever there can be a
reasonable doubt among cataloguers under what head a book
ought to be entered, it should have at least a reference
under each head. The object of an author-catalogue is to
enable one to find the book; if that object is not attained
the book might as well not be catalogued at all.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-061" class="spa7">61</span>.
Make explanatory notes under such words
as <em class="embold">Congress</em>,
<em class="embold">Parliament</em>,

whose entry there is a diverse usage, stating what is
the rule of the catalogue.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="h4m">D. ECONOMIES.</h4>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-062" class="spa7">62</span>.
In the title-a-liners references are not an economy;
they occupy as much room as an entry, and therefore the
imprint may as well be given whenever the reference does
not take the place of several titles.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-063" class="spa7">63</span>.
Mr. Perkins would catalogue directories, state
registers, and local gazetteers under the name of the
place, omitting the author-entry This is for Short alone,
and should never be done by Full or Medium.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-064" class="spa7">64</span>.
Trials of crown, state, and criminal cases may be
entered only under the name of the defendant, and trials
of civil cases under the parties to the suit, treated
like joint authors, and trials relating to vessels under
the name of the vessel (subject-entries of course).
But Full and perhaps Medium should make author-entries
under the reporter. It may be doubted, however, whether
a stenographic reporter is entitled to be considered an
author any more than a type-setter.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Collected reports of trials will of course (§ <a href="#a7-059" title="to &#xa7; 59">59</a>) go under
the collector: for subject-entry they come under the place
over which the court has jurisdiction, and if they relate
to a single crime (as murder), under that also.
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span> </p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-065" class="spa7">65</span>.
Often in analysis it may be worth while to make a
subject-entry and not an author-entry, or vice versâ.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-066" class="spa7">66</span>.
An economical device in some favor is to omit the entry
under the author’s name when the library contains only one
work by him.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>By this practice many famous authors, of whom no small
library is likely to contain more than one work (such as
Boswell, Dante, Gibbon, Lamb, Macaulay, Milton, indeed
almost any of the English poets), will not appear in the
catalogue; while the man who has written both a First class
reader and a Second class reader, or a Mental arithmetic
and a Written arithmetic, or two Sunday-school books, must
be included. It is not necessary to say more to show the
absurdity of the rule. If some authors must be omitted, let
it be those who the librarian knows are never called for,
whether they have written one or fifty works.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-067" class="spa7">67</span>.
Another objectionable economy is to put biographies
under the name of the subject alone, omitting author-entry,
so that there is no means of ascertaining whether the
library possesses all the works of a given author.</p>

<h4 class="h4m">TITLE-ENTRY.</h4>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-068" class="spa7">68</span>.
Make a first-word entry for all&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">[29]</a>
anonymous
works,&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn30" id="fnanc30">[30]</a>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc29" id="fn29">[29]</a>
Of course there are exceptions to this
rule. There are works which are always known by certain
names, under which they should be entered, although the
title-pages of different editions may not begin with this
name, or may not even contain it. The most noteworthy
example is <em class="embold">Bible</em>, which is the best heading—in an
English catalogue—for the Bible and for any of its parts
in whatever language written and under whatever title
published.</p>

<p>This is the British Museum rule. It is of a piece
with putting all periodicals under the heading
<em class="embold">Periodicals</em> and all publications of learned
societies under the head <em class="embold">Academies.</em> It would be
much more in accordance with dictionary principles to put
the separate books of the Bible each under its own name as
given in the revised <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span> English version (<em class="embold">Matthew</em>,
Gospel of, not <em class="embold">Gospel</em> of Matthew), with all
necessary references.</p>

<p>Under the present rule, references should
be made to <em class="embold">Bible</em>
from <em class="embold">Testament</em>,
<em class="embold">Old</em> <em
class="embold">Testament</em>,
<em class="embold">New</em> <em
class="embold">Testament</em>, <em
class="embold">Gospels</em>, <em
class="embold">Apocrypha</em>, <em
class="embold">Psalms</em>, <em
class="embold">Pentateuch</em>, the names of the
single books, and from such well-known names
as <em class="embold">Breeches</em> Bible, <em
class="embold">Speaker’s</em> commentary.</p>

<p>In cataloguing the anonymous books of the Middle Ages,
“Incipit” or “Here begyns,” or “Book the first of,” and
similar phrases are not to be considered as first words.
Thus the history of the Seven Sages appears under the
following variety of title:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Incipit historia septem sapientū <span
class="wdspa">Rome. [Cir.</span> 1475.]</li>

<li>2. In hoc opusculo sunt subtilitates septē
sapientū rome valde <span class="wdspa">p<i>er</i>utiles.
[Later.]</span></li>

<li>3. Historia septem sapientum <span
class="wdspa">Romæ. 1490.</span></li>

<li>4. Historia calumnie nouercalis que septem
sapientū <span class="wdspa">inscribitur.
1490.</span></li>

<li>5. Ludus septem <span class="wdspa">sapientum.
[Cir.</span> 1560.]</li></ul>

<p class="pcontinue">And the titles of the versions are equally various:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Li romans des sept sages.</li>
<li>2. Li romans de Dolopathos.</li>
<li>3. Les sept sages de
<span class="nowrap">Ro<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/mmacron.png"
width="55" height="82" alt="m with macron" />e.</span></li>
<li>4. Les sept saiges de romme.</li>
<li>5. Los siete sabios de Roma.</li>
<li>6. Hieuach volget ein gar schöne Cronick
<span class="nowrap">v<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/nmacron.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="n with macron" /></span>
hystori auss denn Geschichten der Römern.</li>
<li>7. Die hystorie uan die seuen wise mannen van Romen.</li>
<li>8. Hystory of the seuen maysters of Rome.</li>
<li>9. The Hystorie of the seven wise maisters of Rome.</li>
<li>10. The sevin seages.</li>
<li>11. De siu sive mestere.</li></ul>

<p>Of course it will not do to catalogue these severally
under Incipit, Hoc, Historia, Ludus, Romans, Sept, Siete,
Hienach, Hystorie, Hystory, Sevin, and Siu. In this and
other prose and poetical romances of the Middle Ages the
heading must be taken in general from the subject of the
romance; the name appearing of course in the original
language, with all necessary references from other forms.
In the present case all the editions would be collected
under <em class="embold">Septem</em>
sapientes,&#xfeff;[<a href="#fn32" id="fnanc32">[32]</a>]
with references from
Ludus, Sept sages, Siete sabios, Hienach, and Seven,
provided the library has so many editions.</p>

<p>Somewhat similarly collections of papers known by the name
of a principal contributor or a previous owner or of the
house where they were found should be entered under such
name, or, if they must be entered under the name of an
editor, should have a reference from such name; <i>ex.</i>,
Dudley papers, Winthrop papers, etc.</p>

<p>A title like “The modern Plutarch” does not
mean to imply that the work is written by <em
class="embold">Plutarchus</em>; such a book would be
treated as anonymous, unless it had an editor.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc30" id="fn30">[30]</a>
A catalogue of authors alone finds the
entry of its anonymous books a source of incongruity. The
dictionary catalogue has no such trouble. It does not
attempt to enter them in the author-catalogue until the
author’s name is known.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc31" id="fn31">[31]</a>
For a smaller catalogue this may read “except
anonymous works relating to a person, city, or other
subject distinctly mentioned in the title, which
are to be put under the name of the person, city,
or subject.” In the catalogue of a larger library
where more exactness (“red tape,” “pedantry”) is
indispensable, biography should be the only exception,
the place of entry under subjects and under large
cities being <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
too doubtful. And in planning a manuscript catalogue,
it should be remembered that a small library may grow
into a large one, and that if the catalogue is made
in the best way at first there will be no need of
alteration.</p>

<p>If a book’s title-page is lost, and it is impossible to
ascertain what it was from other copies or other editions,
or from catalogues or bibliographies, use the half-title
or the running title, stating the fact; if it has neither,
manufacture a title, within brackets. Such an entry will

Since this was in type I have come to the
conclusion that all these should be entered
under <em class="embold">Sandabad</em> (Lat. <em
class="embold">Syntipas</em>), the reputed author of
the original Indian romance. But the example will
still serve to show the great variety in mediæval
titles, and the inconvenience of following a strict
first-word rule.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-069" class="spa7">69</span>.
A single inscription by an unknown author needs no
title-entry, but should have subject-entry under the
subject of which it treats, or the name of the place where
it is found, or both.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-070" class="spa7">70</span>.
When the author’s name is known, it will be enough
for Medium to make not an entry under the first word,
but a reference from it to the author. The shelf-mark or
class-mark should always be given with this reference, that
the man who merely wishes to get the book need not have
to look in two places for the mark. If there are several
editions all the marks should be given, which is not
satisfactory unless the imprints are also given, that is,
unless an entry is made and not merely a reference.</p>

<p>The entry (or reference) for an anonymous work should be
made, even if the author’s name is given in another edition.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-071" class="spa7">71</span>.
An anonymous work which forms a part of a larger whole
is to be entered where the whole would be, with a reference
from its own title.</p>

Translations of anonymous works should be entered under
the same heading as the original, whether the library
possesses the original or not.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Gisli’s</em> saga. Story of Gish the outlaw, from
the Icelandic, by G. W. Dasent.</p>

<p>So Perron’s translation, called by him “Glaive des
couronnes,” would appear under <em class="embold">Saif</em>-al-tidjan; and
the Arabian nights’ entertainments under <em class="embold">Alif</em> laila.
Criticisms of anonymous works must be put under the heading
of the work criticised.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-073" class="spa7">73</span>.
Periodicals are to be treated as anonymous and entered
under the first word.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Popular</em> science monthly, <em class="embold">Littell’s</em>
living age.</p>

<p>When a periodical changes its title the whole may be
catalogued under the original title, with an explanatory
note there and a reference from the new title to the old;
or each part may be catalogued under its own title, with
references, “For a continuation, <i>see</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,” “For the
previous volumes, <i>see</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Treat almanacs and other annuals as periodicals. Do not
confound periodicals with serials. The four characteristics
of a periodical are: (1) that it be published at intervals
usually but not necessarily regular; (2) in general that
the publication be intended to continue indefinitely; (3)
that it be written by a number of contributors under the
supervision of one or more editors; (4) that it consist
of articles on various subjects, so that a set of the
work does not form an organic whole. The 2d, 3d, and 4th
criteria exclude works like Trollope’s “The way we live
now,” and the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” There are some
exceptions to the 3d, as “Brownson’s quarterly review.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span> </p>

<p>Make a reference from the name of the editor when the
periodical is commonly called by his name, as in the case
of <em class="embold">Silliman’s</em> Journal of science.</p>

<p>The Memoirs, Proceedings, Transactions of a society are
periodicals in point of (1) occasional publication,
(2) indefinite continuance, and—so far as they contain
anything beyond the record of the society’s meetings—of (4)
variety of subject; but they lack the 3d characteristic,
variety of authorship, inasmuch as the memoirs or other
papers given in addition to “proceedings” proper may be
considered as the work of the society acting through its
members; the society, therefore, is the author, and the
Transactions, etc., need not have title-entry. There
are, however, some “Journals” published by or “under the
auspices of” societies which are really periodicals, and
should be so treated in entry, the society being not
the author but the editor. Again, there are works which
occupy a borderland between the two classes, in regard
to which the puzzled cataloguer should remember that it
is not of much importance which way he decides, provided
he is careful to make all necessary references. Examples
of such doubtful cases are “Alpine journal: a record of
mountain adventure and scientific observation. By members
of the Alpine Club;” which contains nothing of or about
the Club itself;—“Journal of the American Institute, a
monthly publication devoted to the interest of agriculture,
commerce, etc. Edited by a committee, members of the
Institute,” and “Journal of the Society of Arts and of The
Institutions in Union,” both of which are journals both
in the sense of record of proceedings and of periodical
publication.</p>

<p>Newspaper titles are troublesome. It is not uncommon for
the name of the place to be included in the name on the
first page (as The Boston Ægis), but to be dropped over the
editorial column, or vice versa, or to be used for some
years and afterwards dropped, or vice versa. The searcher
can not always remember whether it is used or not. It would
be well, therefore, to give under each name of a city the
title of every newspaper published there which the library
has.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-074" class="spa7">74</span>.
Collections of extracts from a periodical should go

<p>The reason is that novels are known more by their titles
than by their authors’ names. Whether to make an entry or a
reference depends on the space at command. An entry means
giving the book-marks for every edition. With a reference
this may be done; but a reference without them obliges the
reader to turn to the author-entry for such details, which
is objectionable. It is better to give all the book-marks
with the title.</p>

<p>If the name of the hero or heroine enters into the title
the entry should be made under that; <i>ex.</i>, <em class="embold">David</em>
Copperfield, Life and adventures of, by C. Dickens.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-076" class="spa7">76</span>.
When a title begins with an article, the heading of a
first-word entry or reference is the word following the
article.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Centaur</em>, The, not fabulous, <i>not</i> <em class="embold">The</em>
centaur not fabulous. The entry has commonly been made
under the first word “not an article or preposition.” But
it is found to work badly to except the preposition in
the titles of novels and plays, and it is awkward to omit
or transpose it in any case. One reason for excepting the
article—that there would be an immense accumulation of
titles under the unimportant words A, The, Le, Der, Uno,
etc.—is not so strong in the case of prepositions; the
other—that it is difficult to remember with what article a
given title begins—hardly applies at all to prepositions.
The preposition is full as likely to fasten itself in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span> memory as the word that follows it. The strongest
argument in favor of confining preposition-entry to fiction
and the drama is that in other cases the word following
the preposition will probably be a subject-word, so that
one entry will do the work of two. This will occasionally
be true, but not often enough, I think, to make much
difference.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-077" class="spa7">77</span>.
When a foreign phrase is used as an English title,
refer from the article as well as from the following word.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">El
Fureidis</em> should have references to
<em class="embold">Cummins</em> both under <em class="embold">E</em> and <em class="embold">F</em>;

<em class="embold">Heyse.</em></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-078" class="spa7">78</span>.
When a title begins with a word expressive of the
number which the work holds in a series the first-word
entry or reference is to be made under the next word.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Collection</em> of papers, 8th, <i>not</i> <em class="embold">Eighth</em>
collection. <em class="embold">Letter</em>, 1st and 2d, to the Ministry,
<i>not</i> <em class="embold">First</em> letter, etc., under <em class="embold">F</em>, and
<em class="embold">Second</em> letter under <em class="embold">S.</em> When the numeral comes
after a word like Book or Part (as frequently in Latin
after Liber, Pars, Tomus, Volumen) both are to be neglected
and the word following put into the nominative and used
as a heading; <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, “Pars prima epistolarum” is to be
entered under <em class="embold">Epistolæ.</em> Similarly Evening, Morning,
Daily, and Weekly should be disregarded in titles of
newspapers, otherwise we should have the morning edition at
one end of the catalogue and the evening at the other. So
“Appendix to,” “Continuation of” “Supplement to” (but not
“Reply to”), are to be disregarded when they are followed
by the title of the work continued. “Reply to” and similar
beginnings are to be put under <em class="embold">Reply</em>, etc., with a
subject-entry under the author of the work replied to.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-079" class="spa7">79</span>.
When the first word of a title is spelled unusually,
all the editions should be entered under the word spelled
in the modern or correct way, with a reference from the
form adopted in the title.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> The hystorie of the saints would be <span class="nowrap">entered—</span></p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">History.]</em> The hystorie of the saints.</p>

<p>We enter under the common spelling (1) in order to get all
editions of a work together, (2) because the reader can not
be expected to know exactly how the word is misspelled in
the title, and will generally look first under the correct
spelling.</p>

<p>Of two spellings equally correct, choose one and refer from
the other.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-080" class="spa7">80</span>.
When the first word of a title is in an oblique case,
use the nominative as a heading.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-081" class="spa7">81</span>.
If the title has various forms, refer from any that
differ enough to affect the alphabetical order.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">

Modern anonymous works whose titles are changed in
different editions may be entered under the first, with a
reference under the later; but the most satisfactory method
is to enter in full in both places.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-083" class="spa7">83</span>.
Anonymous works that change their titles in successive
volumes are to be entered under the first title, with a
reference from the later, unless the greater part of the
work has the later title, or the whole is much better known
by the later title, in which case entry should be made
under that. <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span></p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-084" class="spa7">84</span>.

<p>Of course entries are better than references for the
reader; the latter are recommended here merely for economy,
which will be found to be considerable when there are many
editions of a play. It is much better to distribute these
like any other title-references, through the alphabet,
than, as some have done, to collect the titles of novels
together in one place and of plays in another. A man not
unfrequently wishes to find a book whose title he has heard
of without learning whether it was a novel, a play, a poem,
or a book of travels.</p>

<p>If the catch-word of the title of a novel, poem, or play
is the name of a real person who is its subject, it is
optional to make a reference, as in § <a href="#a7-086" title="to &#xa7; 86">86</a>, or a biographical
entry under the family name, or both.</p>

<p>In a majority of cases, when a subject-word entry is made,
no first-word reference is needed; but, if the title is
striking, there should be a first-word reference, or a
reference from that part of the title which is striking.
Title-references should not generally be made from certain
common titles, as “<em class="embold">Sermons</em> on various subjects,”
“<em class="embold">Essays</em>, historical and literary,” and should be
made from less common collective words, as “<em class="embold">Century</em>
of painters,” “<em class="embold">Century</em> of praise,” etc. References
should be liberally made to the works of such authors as
Brown, Jones, Schmidt, Smith, Wilson; if one has forgotten
the Christian name, it is a work of too much time to find
the book under the author, and one looks at once for a
subject- or a title-entry or reference. And a reference
will facilitate the finding of many collections entered
properly under the editor; for it is easy to forget an
editor’s name, and often difficult to determine the
subject-entry of a collection.</p>

phrase very likely to remain <span class="xxpn"

the title-entry there. Thus an anonymous book, “France

some subdivision of <em class="embold">France</em>, but as this in a large
catalogue would be little help towards finding the book, it

<p>The reason for this is that the inquirer might not think
of looking for such works under those headings or might
be unable to find them in the mass of titles under the
larger countries, France, Great Britain, United States.
But in view of the room which such references would fill,
if made from all governmental titles, it seems best to
state the rule for the entry of governmental and society
publications very distinctly in the preface and then to
require and presuppose a certain acquaintance with the
plan of the catalogue on the part of those who use it,
and omit all reference for ordinary official reports,
making them only for works which have become part of
literature, and are likely to be much inquired for: as,
the “Astronomical exploring expedition,” “Connaissance des
temps,” “Description de l’Égypte,” “Documents inédits,”
“Philosophical transactions,” etc. Of course absolute
uniformity can not be secured in this way, but absolute
uniformity is not very important. Even if occasionally
a reference of this kind fails to be made which might
reasonably be required, those which are made will be
useful. It is easy to add the reference wanted in a
manuscript catalogue or in the inevitable supplement of a

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Because some books are known and referred
to by them rather than by the full title. For
the same reason the binder’s title, used on the
original binding, may deserve a reference (never
an entry); and also titles commonly given to
books though not appearing anywhere in them,
as <em class="embold">Breeches</em> Bible, <em
class="embold">Speaker’s</em> commentary.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-091" class="spa7">91</span>.
If a book has several title-pages use the most general,
giving the others, if necessary, in a note or as contents.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>This occurs especially in German books. The rule
above should be followed even when the library has
only one of the parts. But under the subject-heading
the subtitle which corresponds to that subject may be
used, the general title being given in a parenthesis
after the imprint, so as to preserve the connection of
the subject- and <span class="wdspa">title-entries.

<h5 class="h5m">(a.) <span

class="smmaj">CONSIDERED SEPARATELY.</span></h5>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-092" class="spa7">92</span>.
Some questions in regard to the place of entry are
common to the author- and the subject-catalogue; because
individuals (persons, places, ships, etc.) may be at once
authors and subjects. For these questions consult Part I,
and also § <a href="#a7-100" title="to &#xa7; 100">100</a> of the present part.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In a dictionary catalogue some books can not profitably
have subject-entry, because they not only have no one
subject but do not even belong to any class of subjects.</p>

<p>A collection is to be entered under the word which
expresses its subject or its general tendency. The memoirs,
transactions, proceedings, etc., of a society should be
entered under name of the object for which the society is
founded. When there are many societies under one head, it
is economical to refer merely; as, from <em class="embold">Agriculture</em>
or <em class="embold">Agricultural
societies</em> to the various names.</p>

<p>The importance of deciding aright where any given subject
shall be entered is in inverse proportion to the difficulty
of decision. If there is no obvious principle to guide the
cataloguer, it is plain there will be no reason why the
public should expect to find the entry under one heading
rather than another, and therefore in regard to the public
it matters not which is chosen. But it is better that such
decisions should be made to conform when possible to some
general system, as there is then more likelihood that they
will be decided alike by different cataloguers, and that
a usage will grow up which the public will finally learn
and profit by, as a usage has grown up in regard to the
author-entry of French names containing De, Du, La, etc.</p></div>

<div class="ph7m">(a.) Between general and specific.</div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-093" class="spa7">93</span>.
Enter a work under its subject-heading, not under the
heading of a class which includes that subject.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> Put Lady Cust’s book on “The
cat” under <em class="embold">Cat</em>,
not under <em class="embold">Zoölogy</em>
or <em class="embold">Mammals</em>, or
<em class="embold">Domestic</em> <em
class="embold">animals</em>; and put Garnier’s
“Le fer” under <em class="embold">Iron</em>,
not under <em class="embold">Metals</em> or <em
class="embold">Metallurgy.</em></p>

<p>This rule of “specific entry” is the main
distinction between the dictionary-catalogue and the
alphabetico-classed.</p>

<p>Some subjects have no name; they are spoken of only
by a phrase or by several phrases not definite enough
to be used as a heading. A book may be written on the
movements of fluids in plants, a very definite object of
investigation, but as yet nameless; it must be put under
Botany (Physiological). But if several works were written
on it and it was called, let us say, <em class="embold">Phythydraulics</em>,
it would be seen that, under this rule, it no more ought to
be under <em class="embold">Botany</em> than <em class="embold">Circulation of the
blood</em>
under <em class="embold">Zoölogy.</em> Thirty years ago “Fertilization of
flowers” could hardly have been used as a heading; but
late writings have raised it to the status of a subject.
There are thousands of possible matters of investigation,
some of which are from time to time discussed, but before
the catalogue can profitably follow its “specific” rule in
regard to them they must attain a certain individuality
as objects of inquiry, and be given some sort of <i>name</i>,
otherwise we must assign them class-entry.</p>

<p>And it is not always easy to decide what is a distinct
subject. Many catalogues have a heading <em class="embold">Preaching.</em>
Is Extempore preaching a sufficiently distinct matter to
have a heading of its own? There are a number of books
on this branch of the <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span> subject. In this particular
case the difficulty can be avoided by making the heading
“<em class="embold">Preaching without
notes.</em>” Many such questions may
be similarly solved, with perhaps more satisfaction to
the maker of the catalogue than to its users; but many
questions will remain.</p>

<p>Then, mixed with this, and sometimes hardly distinguishable
from it, is the case of subjects whose names begin within
an unimportant adjective or noun,—Are of the meridian,
Capture of property at sea, Segment of a circle, Quadrature
of the circle. All that can be said in such cases is that,
if the subject be commonly recognized and the name accepted
or likely to be accepted by usage, the entry must be made
under it. For the fuller discussion of compound headings,
see §§ <a href="#a7-106" title="to &#xa7; 106">106</a>,
<a href="#a7-107" title="to &#xa7; 107">107</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, difficulty arises from the public,
or a part of it, being accustomed to think of certain
subjects in connection with their including classes,
which especially happens to those persons who have used
classed catalogues or the dictionary catalogues in which
specification is only partially carried out; so that there
is a temptation to enter certain books doubly, once under
the specific heading to satisfy the rule, and once under
the class to satisfy the public. The dictionary principle
does not forbid this. If room can be spared, the cataloguer
may put what he pleases under an extensive subject (a
class), provided he puts the less comprehensive works also
under their respective specific headings. The objection to
this is that, if all the specifics are thus entered, the
bulk of the catalogue is enormously increased; and that,
if a selection is made, it must depend entirely upon the
“judgment,” <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, the prepossessions and accidental
associations, of the cataloguer, and there will be an end
to all uniformity, and probably the public will not be
better satisfied, not understanding why they do not find
class-entry in all cases.</p></div>

<div class="ph7m">(b.) Choice between person and country.</div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-094" class="spa7">94</span>.
Put under the name of a king or other ruler all his
biographies, and works purporting to be histories of his
reign; but enter under the country all histories which
include more than his reign and accounts of events which
happened during the reign, and all political pamphlets not
directly criticising his conduct.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>The first part of this rule is analogous to that by which
the works of a king of a private nature are put under
his name, and all his public writings under the country;
putting histories of the reign under the king is partly
subject- and partly title-entry. Books of this sort have
really two subjects and ought to be entered twice (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>,
Boutaric’s “La France sous Philippe le bel”); the rule
above is simply an economical device to save room at the
expense of convenience. Perhaps a better practice would be
to enter all lives of kings as well as histories of their
reigns under the country only, with a reference from the
king.</p>

<p>Similarly there are some biographies and autobiographies
which have such a very large proportion of history that
they ought to appear both under the man and the country. In
general we merely refer from the country, but occasionally
nothing but double entry will suffice. Whether they shall
appear by way of entry or merely be mentioned in a note,
must be determined by circumstances.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-096" class="spa7">96</span>.
The only satisfactory method is double entry under
the local and the scientific subject—to put, for
instance, a work on the geology of California
under both <em class="embold">California</em>
and <em class="embold">Geology</em>, and to
carry out this practice through the catalogue,
so that the geographical student shall not
be obliged to search for works on California
under <em class="embold">Botany</em>,
<em class="embold">Geology</em>,
<em class="embold">Natural</em> <em
class="embold">history</em>, <em
class="embold">Palæon­tol­ogy</em>, <em
class="embold">Zoölogy</em>, and a dozen
similar headings, and the scientist shall not
be sent to <em class="embold">California</em>,
<em class="embold">England</em>, <em
class="embold">Russia</em>, and a score of other
places to find the various treatises on geology. But
as this profusion of entry would make the catalogue
very long, we are generally obliged to choose between
country and scientific subject.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-097" class="spa7">97</span>.
A work treating of a general subject with special
reference to a place is to be entered under the place, with
merely a reference from the subject.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> Put Flagg’s “Birds and seasons of New England” under
<em class="embold">New
England</em>, and under <em class="embold">Ornithology</em> say <i>See
also</i> <em class="embold">New
England.</em> As <em class="embold">New England
ornithology</em>
and <em class="embold">Ornithology of New
England</em> are merely different
names of the same specific subject, it may be asked why
we prefer the first. Because entry under <em class="embold">Ornithology
of New
England</em>, though by itself specific entry, is
when taken in connection with the entries that would be
grouped around it (<em class="embold">Ornithology</em>, <em class="embold">Ornithology of
America</em>, <em class="embold">Ornithology of
Scotland</em>, etc.), in
effect class-entry; whereas the similar grouping under New
England does not make that a class, inasmuch as <em class="embold">New
England
botany</em>, <em class="embold">New England
history</em>, <em class="embold">New
England
ornithology</em> are not parts of New England, but
simply the individual New England considered in various
aspects. Of course the dictionary catalogue in choosing
between a class and an individual prefers the latter. Its
object is to show at one view all the sides of each object;
the classed catalogue shows together the same side of many
objects.</p>

<p>There is not as yet much uniformity in catalogues, nor
does any carry out this principle so absolutely as the
more obvious “specific” rule is obeyed. The Boston Public
Library Supplement of 1866, for instance, has under
the country <i>Antiquities</i>, <i>Coinage</i>, <i>Description</i>
and <i>History</i>, <i>Language</i>, <i>Religion</i> (subjects), and
<i>Literature</i>, and even <i>Elocution</i> and <i>Poetry</i> (forms),
but not <i>Ballads</i> nor <i>Periodicals</i>, which appear under
those words. Yet when Ballads are called Volkslieder they
appear under the country Germany,—an instance of the
independence of the title produced by foreign languages,
the English title being entered by form-word, the foreign
works having national classification, regardless of
the title. There are many other classes that in most
catalogues at present, instead of being confined to
general works, absorb books which should rather have local
entry, as <em class="embold">Vases</em>, <em class="embold">Gems</em>, <em class="embold">Sculpture</em>,
<em class="embold">Painting</em>, and other branches of the fine arts,
<em class="embold">Ballads</em>, <em class="embold">Epigrams</em>, <em class="embold">Plays</em>, and other
forms of literature. In catalogues of merely English
libraries this is perhaps as well (see § <a href="#a7-122" title="to &#xa7; 122">122</a>), but the
multiplication of books and the accession of foreign
literatures render more system necessary.</p>

<p>To show the procedure under this rule, suppose we have a
collection of books on coins. Let the general works go
under <em class="embold">Numismatics</em>; let works on any particular
coin, as a <em class="embold">Pine-tree
shilling</em> or a <em class="embold">Queen Anne’s
farthing</em>, go under the name of the coin; let works on
the coins of a country be put under its name; refer from
the country to all the particular coins on which you have
monographs, and from <em class="embold">Numismatics</em> both to all the
separate coins and to all the countries on whose coinage
you have treatises. <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span></p></div>

Among subjects that overlap choose the one that
preponderates, with a reference from the other.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> Any complete treatise on domestic animals will cover
a large part of the ground of veterinary medicine; but it
is unnecessary to enter all the works on domestic animals
under <em class="embold">Veterinary
medicine</em>; a note to this effect is
sufficient. <em class="embold">Astronomy</em> and <em class="embold">Geology</em> overlap
in regard to the origin of the earth, <em class="embold">Geology</em>
and <em class="embold">Physical
geography</em> in regard to its present
condition. Any particular book must be classified with
one or the other subject according as the geological or
geographical treatment prevails.</p></div>

General rules, always applicable, for the choice of
names of subjects can no more be given than rules without
exception in grammar. Usage in both cases is the supreme
arbiter,—the usage, in the present case, not of the
cataloguer but of the public in speaking of subjects.</p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-100" class="spa7">100</span>.
When possible let the heading be in English, but a
foreign word may be used when no English word expresses the
subject of a book.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Écorcheurs</em>,
<em class="embold">Émigrés</em>, <em
class="embold">Raskolnik.</em> Many terms of the
Roman or civil law are not exactly translatable;
neither Fault nor Crime gives the idea of Culpa;
the Debitor inops is not our bankrupt or insolvent;
he would have been very glad to have the privileges
of a bankrupt. Some other technical terms, and some
names of bodies, sects, events, should be left in the
original language. The use of the Latin names of Greek
deities (Jupiter, Neptune, Venus, in place of Zeus,
Poseidon, Aphrodite) is a manifest inaccuracy. Yet
it may be defended on the plea: (1) that the Latin
names are at present more familiar to the majority
of readers; (2) that it would be difficult to divide
the literature, or if it were done, many books must
be put both under <em class="embold">Zeus</em>
and <em class="embold">Jupiter</em>, <em
class="embold">Poseidon</em> and <em
class="embold">Neptune</em>, etc., filling
considerable room with no practical advantage.</p>

<p>On the language of place names, see

<div class="ph7m">(g.) Synonyms.</div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-101" class="spa7">101</span>.
Of two exactly synonymous names choose one and make a
reference from the other.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Poisons</em> and <em class="embold">Toxicology</em>;
<em class="embold">Antiquities</em> and <em class="embold">Archæology</em>; <em class="embold">Insects</em>
and <em class="embold">Entomology</em>; <em class="embold">Warming</em> and <em class="embold">Heating</em>;
<em class="embold">Pacific
Ocean</em> and <em class="embold">South
Sea.</em> There are some
cases in which separate headings (<em class="embold">Hydraulics</em> and
<em class="embold">Mechanics of
Fluids</em>), which can not be combined,
cover books almost identical in character, so that the
inquirer must look under both. This is an evil; but there
is no reason for increasing the evil by separating headings
that are really synonymous, certainly not for dividing a
subject in this way for verbal causes and giving no hint
that it has been divided.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a different name is given to
the same subject at different periods of its history.
When the method of study of the subject, or its objects,
or the ideas connected with it, are very different at
those two periods (as in the case of <em class="embold">Alchemy</em> and
<em class="embold">Chemistry</em>), of course there must be two headings.
There is not so much reason for separating Fluxions and
Differential calculus, which differ only in notation.
And there is no reason at all for separating <em class="embold">Natural
Philosophy</em> and <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span> <em class="embold">Physics.</em> I am told that
medical nomenclature has changed largely three times within
the present century. How is the cataloguer, unless he
happens to be a medical man, to escape occasionally putting
works on one disease under three different heads?</p>

<p>To arrive at a decision in any case one must balance the
advantages on the one hand of having all that relates
to a subject together, and on the other of making that
economical conjunction of title-entry and of subject-entry
which comes from following the titles of the books in
selecting names for their subjects.</p>

<p>In choosing between synonymous headings prefer the one <span class="nowrap">that—</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) is most familiar to that class of people who consult
the library; a natural history society will of course
use the scientific name, a town library would equally of
course use the popular name—<em class="embold">Butterflies</em> rather than
<em class="embold">Lepidoptera</em>, <em class="embold">Horse</em> rather than <em class="embold">Equus
caballus.</em> But the scientific may be preferable when the
common name is ambiguous or of ill-defined extent.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) is most used in other catalogues.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) has fewest meanings other than the sense in which it
is to be employed.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) comes first in the alphabet, so that the reference
from the other can be made to the exact page of the
catalogue.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) brings the subject into the neighborhood of
other related subjects. It is, for instance, often an
advantage to have near any art or science the lives
of those who have been famous in it; as, <em class="embold">Art</em>,
<em class="embold">Artists</em>; <em class="embold">Painters</em>, <em class="embold">Painting</em>;
<em class="embold">Historians</em>, <em class="embold">History.</em> If one were
hesitating between <em class="embold">Conjuring</em>, <em class="embold">Juggling</em>,
<em class="embold">Legerdemain</em>, <em class="embold">Prestidigitation</em>, and <em class="embold">Sleight
of
hand</em>, it would be in favor of <em class="embold">Conjuring</em> or
<em class="embold">Prestidigitation</em> that one could enter by their side
<em class="embold">Conjurors</em> or <em class="embold">Prestidigitators.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes one and sometimes another of these reasons must
prevail. Each case is to be decided on its own merits.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-102" class="spa7">102</span>.
In choosing between two names not exactly synonymous,
consider whether there is difference enough to require
separate entry; if not, treat them as synonymous.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Culture</em> and <em class="embold">Civilization</em>,
<em class="embold">Culture</em> and <em class="embold">Education.</em></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-103" class="spa7">103</span>.
Of two subjects exactly opposite choose one and refer
from the other.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Temperance</em> and <em class="embold">Intemperance</em>, <em class="embold">Free
Trade</em> and <em class="embold">Protection</em>, <em class="embold">Authority</em> (in
religion) and <em class="embold">Private
judgment.</em> Reasons for choice
the same as between synonyms.</p>

<p>To this rule there may be exceptions. It may be best that
works on theism and atheism should be put together, perhaps
under the heading <em class="embold">God</em>; but Theists and Atheists as
bodies of religious believers ought certainly to go under

<p>It is strange that the delusion ever should have arisen
that “a catalogue must of necessity confine itself to
titles only of books.” If it does, it can not enter that
very considerable number of books whose titles make no
mention or only an obscure or a defective mention of their
subjects (§ <a href="#a7-085" title="to &#xa7; 85">85</a>), and it is at the mercy of deceptive
titles (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, Channing’s sermon “On a future life,”
which treats of Heaven only, Irving’s History of New York,
Gulliver’s Travels). A man who is looking up the history of
the Christian church does not care in the least whether the
books on it were called by their authors church histories
or ecclesiastical histories; and the cataloguer also
should not care if he can avoid it. The title rules the
title-catalogue; let it confine itself to that province.

<p><i>E.</i> <i>g.</i>, it will not do to confound works on the

design” or a work on “Wagner and his school” are not to
be put under <em class="embold">Education.</em> Special care is of course
needed with foreign titles; the cataloguer may be easily
misled by the sound if he is not on his guard. I have seen

<div class="ph7m">(j.) Compound subject-names.</div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-106" class="spa7">106</span>.
The name of a subject may <span class="nowrap">be—</span></p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p class="pa7a">(<i>a</i>) A single word, as <em
class="embold">Botany</em>, <em
class="embold">Ethics.</em></p>

<p>Or several words taken together, <span class="nowrap">either—</span></p>

<p class="pa7a">(<i>b</i>) A noun preceded by an adjective, as <em class="embold">Ancient
history</em>, <em class="embold">Capital
punishment</em>, <em class="embold">Moral
philosophy.</em></p>

<p class="pa7a">(<i>c</i>) A noun preceded by another noun used like
an adjective, as <em class="embold">Death
penalty</em>, <em class="embold">Flower
fertilization.</em></p>

<p class="pa7a">(<i>d</i>) A noun connected with another by a preposition, as
<em class="embold">Penalty of
death</em>, <em class="embold">Fertilization of
flowers.</em></p>

<p class="pa7a">(<i>e</i>) A noun connected with another by “and,” as
<em class="embold">Ancients and
moderns.</em></p>

<p class="pa7a">(<i>f</i>) A sentence, as in the titles “Sur la règle <em class="embold">Paterna
paternis materna
maternis</em>” and “De usu paroemiae juris
Germanici, <em class="embold">Der Letzte thut die Thüre
zu</em>;” where the
whole phrase would be the subject of the dissertation.</p>

<p>There are three main courses open:</p>

<p class="pa7a">(1) We can consider the subject to be the phrase <i>as it
reads</i>, as <em class="embold">Agricultural
chemistry</em>, <em class="embold">Survival of
the
fittest</em>, which is the only possible method in
(<i>a</i>) and undoubtedly the best method in (<i>c</i>), (<i>e</i>), and
(<i>f</i>), and in most cases of proper names, as <em class="embold">Democratic
Party</em>, <em class="embold">White
Mountains</em>, <em class="embold">Missouri
River</em>
(but see § <a href="#a7-026" title="to &#xa7; 26">26</a>).</p>

<p class="pa7a">(2) We can make our entry in (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>)
under what we consider the most significant word of the
phrase, inverting the order of the words if necessary;
as, <em class="embold">Probabilities</em> (instead of <em class="embold">Theory</em>
of probabilities); <em class="embold">Earth</em>, Figure of the;
<em class="embold">Species</em>, Origin of the, the word Origin here being
by itself of no account; <em class="embold">Alimentary</em> canal, Canal
being by itself of no account; <em class="embold">Political</em> economy,
Political being here the main word and economy by itself
having a meaning entirely different from that which it has
in this connection.</p>

<p class="pa7a">(3) We can take the phrase as it reads in (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>),
(<i>e</i>), and (<i>f</i>), but make a special rule for a noun
preceded by an adjective (<i>b</i>), <i>first</i>, that all such
phrases shall when possible be reduced to their equivalent
nouns, as <em class="embold">Moral
philosophy</em> to <em class="embold">Ethics</em> or to
<em class="embold">Morals,
Intellectual</em>; or <em class="embold">Mental
philosophy</em>
to <em class="embold">Intellect</em>; or <em class="embold">Mind, Natural
philosophy</em> to
<em class="embold">Physics, Sanitary
science</em>; or <em class="embold">Hygiene, Scientific
men</em> to <em class="embold">Scientists</em>; or <em class="embold">Social
science</em> to
<em class="embold">Sociology</em>; and, <i>secondly</i>, that in all cases where
such reduction is impossible the words shall be inverted
and the noun taken as the heading, as <em class="embold">Chemistry</em>,
Agricultural; <em class="embold">Chemistry</em>, Organic; <em class="embold">Anatomy</em>,
Comparative; <em class="embold">History</em>, Ancient; <em class="embold">History</em>,
Ecclesiastical; <em class="embold">History</em>, Modern; <em class="embold">History</em>,
Natural; <em class="embold">History</em>, Sacred.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40" id="fnanc40">[40]</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span></p>

<p>The objection to (1) is that it may be pushed
to an absurd extent in the case (<i>b</i>). A man might
plausibly assert that Ancient Egypt is a distinct
subject from Modern Egypt, having a recognized name
of its own, as much so as Ancient history, and
might therefore demand that the one should be put
under <em class="embold">A</em> (Ancient) and the
other under <em class="embold">M</em> (Modern)&#x2009;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn41" id="fnanc41">[41]</a> and
similar claims might be made in the case of all
subject-names to which an adjective is ever prefixed,
which would result in filling the catalogue with a
host of unexpected and therefore useless headings.
Nevertheless the rule seems to me the best if due
discrimination be used in choosing subject-names.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc40" id="fn40">[40]</a>
This rule is proposed by Mr. Schwartz and
carried out, with some exceptions, in his catalogue of the
New York Apprentices’ Library.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc41" id="fn41">[41]</a>
Which would be much like putting
Williams’s “Shakespeare’s Youth” under <em
class="embold">Youthful</em> Shakespeare. Individuals
should not be divided.</p></div>

<p>The objection to (2) is that there would often be
disagreement as to what is “the most important word
of the phrase,” so that the rule would be no guide to
the reader. But in connection with (1) and as a guard
against its excesses (2) has its value. The combined
rule might read:</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-107" class="spa7">107</span>.
Enter a compound subject-name by its first word,
inverting the phrase only when some other word is decidedly
more significant or is often used alone with the same
meaning as the whole name.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Special</em>
<em class="embold">providences</em> and <em class="embold">Providence</em>,
<em class="embold">Proper</em>
<em class="embold">names</em> and <em class="embold">Names.</em></p>

<p>It must be confessed that this rule is somewhat vague and
that it would be often of doubtful application, and that on
the other hand (3) is clear and easy to follow. But there
are objections to (3). It would put a great many subjects
under words where nobody unacquainted with the rule would
expect to find them.</p>

<p>Another objection is that in most cases the noun expresses
a class, the adjective limits the noun, and makes the
name that of a subclass (as International law, Remittent
disease, Secret societies, Sumptuary laws, Typhoid fever,
Venemous insects, Whig party, Woolen manufactures), and to
adopt the noun (the class) as the heading is to violate
the fundamental principle of the dictionary catalogue. The
rule is urged, however, not on the ground of propriety
or congruity with the rest of the system but simply
as convenient, as a purely arbitrary rule which <i>once
understood</i> will be a certain guide for the reader. “If he
is told that he shall always find a subject arranged under
its substantive form and never under an adjective he can
hardly fail to find it. If, on the other hand, he is
told that Comparative anatomy is under <em class="embold">C</em> and Morbid
anatomy under <em class="embold">A</em>, that Physical geography is under
<em class="embold">P</em> and Mathematical geography under <em class="embold">G</em>, he will
only be bewildered, and accuse the cataloguer of making
distinctions that it requires too much study to appreciate.
Theoretically the distinctions may be justified, but
practically the simpler way of using the noun only is
more <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span> easily grasped by the common mind. And the
system of classifying names under the surname is precisely
analogous;&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnanc42">[42]</a>
thus</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Smith</em>, John,</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Smith</em>, Joseph,</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Smith</em>, William,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">seems to me to be arranged on the same principle as</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">History</em>, Ancient,</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">History</em>, Ecclesiastical,</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">History</em>, Modern,</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">History</em>,
 Sacred.”&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnanc43">[43]</a></p>

<p>This is plausible. If the public could ever get as
accustomed to the inversion of subject-names as they
are to the inversion of personal names the rule would
undoubtedly be very convenient; but it might be difficult
to teach the rule. The catalogue treatment of personal
names is familiar to every one, because it is used in all
catalogues, dictionaries, directories, and indexes. But
there are less than three hundred subject-names consisting
of adjective and noun in a catalogue which has probably
over 50,000 names of persons. The use of the rule would
be so infrequent that it would not remain in the memory.
And it should be observed that the confusion caused by
the different treatment of Morbid anatomy and Comparative
anatomy would only occur to a man who was examining the
system of the catalogue, and not to the ordinary user. A
man looks in the catalogue for treatises on <em class="embold">Comparative</em>
<em class="embold">anatomy</em>; he finds it, where he first looks, under
<em class="embold">C.</em> He does not know anything about the disposition
of works on Morbid anatomy, and is not confused by it.
Another man looks for works on Morbid anatomy and under
<em class="embold">M</em> he is referred to <em class="embold">Anatomy</em>, <i>Morbid.</i>&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn44" id="fnanc44">[44]</a>
He finds there what he wants and does not stop to notice
that <em class="embold">Comparative</em>
<em class="embold">anatomy</em> is not there, but under
<em class="embold">C</em>, consequently he is not puzzled by that. And
even those who are taking a general survey of all that
the library possesses on anatomy would probably be too
intent upon their object to pause and criticise the
arrangement, provided the reference from <em class="embold">Anatomy</em> to
<em class="embold">Comparative</em>
<em class="embold">Anatomy</em> were perfectly clear, so that
they ran no risk of overlooking it and had no difficulty in
finding the subject referred to.</p>

<p>The specific-entry rule is one which the reader of a
dictionary catalogue must learn if he is to use it with any
facility; it is much better that he should not be burdened
with learning an exception to this, which the noun rule
certainly is.</p>

<p>It ought also to be noticed that this plan does not escape
all the difficulties of the others. In reducing, for
instance, Intellectual philosophy or Moral philosophy, will
you say Mind or Intellect, Morals or Ethics? And the reader
will not always know what the equivalent noun is,—that
Physics = Natural Philosophy, for example, and Hygiene =
Sanitary science. Nor does it help us at all to decide
whether to prefer Botanical morphology or Morphological
botany. These difficulties, which beset any rule, are only
mentioned here lest too much should be expected from a plan
which at first sight seems to solve all problems.</p>

<p>The practice of reducing a name to the substantive form is
often a good one; but should not be insisted upon as an
invariable rule, as it might lead to the adoption of some
very out-of-the-way names. As a mere matter of form Nebulæ
is to be preferred for a heading to Nebular hypothesis,
Pantheism to Pantheistic theory, Lyceums to Lyceum system,
etc. <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span> </p>

<p>In (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>) the same subject can often be
named in different ways; as,</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">(<i>b</i>)</td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Capital</em>
 <em class="embold">punishment.</em></td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Floral</em> <em
 class="embold">fertilization.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">(<i>c</i>)</td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Death</em> <em
 class="embold">penalty.</em></td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Flower</em> <em
 class="embold">fertilization.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">(<i>d</i>)</td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Penalty of</em>
 <em class="embold">death.</em></td>
 <td class="tdleft"><em class="embold">Fertilization
 of flowers.</em></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Is there any principle upon which the choice between these
three can be made, so that the cataloguer shall always
enter books on the same subject under the same heading? I
see none. When there is any decided usage (<i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, custom
of the public to designate the subjects by one of the names
rather than by the others) let it be followed; that is to
say, if, in the examples given above, the more customary
phrases are <em class="embold">Capital</em>
<em class="embold">punishment</em>, <em class="embold">Fertilization of</em>
<em class="embold">flowers</em>, then we must use those names, preferring in
the first case the name which begins with an adjective to
its equivalent beginning with a noun, and in the other the
name beginning with a noun to its equivalent beginning with
an adjective. As is often the case in language, usage will
be found not to follow any uniform course.</p>

<p>If usage manifests no preference for either name, we can
not employ the two indifferently; we must choose one;
and some slight guide to choice in certain cases may
perhaps be found. On examination of the phrases above, it
appears that they are not all of the same composition. In
<em class="embold">Comparative</em>
<em class="embold">anatomy</em>, <em class="embold">Capital</em>
<em class="embold">punishment</em>,
the noun is the name of a general subject, one of whose
subdivisions is indicated by the adjective. And Capital,
Comparative have only this limiting power; they do not
imply any general subject. But <em class="embold">Ancient</em>
<em class="embold">history</em>,
<em class="embold">Mediæval</em>
<em class="embold">history</em>, etc., may be viewed not only in
this way (History the class, Ancient history and Mediæval
history the subdivisions) but also as equivalent to
<em class="embold">Antiquity</em>: <i>History</i>, <em class="embold">Middle</em>
<em class="embold">Ages</em>: <i>History</i>
(as we say <em class="embold">Europe</em>: <em class="embold">History</em>), in which case
the adjectives (Ancient, Mediæval) imply a subject and
the noun (History) indicates the aspect in which the
subject is viewed. Here, then, we choose <em class="embold">Ancient</em>
and <em class="embold">Mediæval</em> as the heading, on the principle of §
<a href="#a7-068" title="to &#xa7; 68">68</a>. So in (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) each of the nouns in turn may
be considered as expressing the more general idea and the
other as limiting it; <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, we can have various headings
for Death considered in different lights, among others as
a penalty; and we can have headings of various sorts of
penalties, among others death. It is evident that this
collection of penalties taken together makes up a class,
and therefore this belongs to a style of entry which the
dictionary catalogue is expected to avoid; but the series
of headings beginning with the word Death would not make a
class, being merely different aspects of the same thing,
not different subordinate parts of the same subject.</p>

<p>When an adjective implies the name of a place,
as in <em class="embold">French</em>
<em class="embold">literature</em>,
<em class="embold">German</em>
<em class="embold">philosophy</em>, <em
class="embold">Greek</em>
<em class="embold">art</em>, it is most convenient
on the whole to make the subject a division under
the country. In this way all that relates to
a country is brought together and arranged in
one alphabetical series of subjects under its
name (see § <a href="#a7-258" title="to &#xa7; 258">258</a>). It is not of the slightest
importance that this introduces the <i>appearance</i>
of an alphabetico-classed catalogue, so long as
the main object of a dictionary, ready reference,
is attained. Of course <em class="embold">Hebrew</em>
<em class="embold">language</em>, <em class="embold">Latin</em>
<em class="embold">language</em>,
<em class="embold">Latin</em>
<em class="embold">literature</em>, and <em
class="embold">Punic</em>
<em class="embold">language</em> can not be so
treated; it is the custom and is probably best not
to put <em class="embold">English</em>
<em class="embold">language</em> and
<em class="embold">English</em>
<em class="embold">literature</em> under <em
class="embold">England</em>, as they have extended
far beyond the place of their origin; books on
the language spoken in the United States go with
those on the English language except the few on <em
class="embold">Americanisms</em>, which are separated,
like accounts of any other dialect. Our literature
can not be treated satisfactorily. It is never called
United States literature, and no one would expect
to find it under United States. On the other hand
the name American properly should include Canadian
literature and all the Spanish literature of South
America. It is, however, the best name we have.</p></div>

<p class="pa7a">Under first word of title, if the book is anonymous or the title is memorable. <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span></p>

and therefore the cost of the catalogue increases in direct
proportion with the multiplication of entries, it becomes
worth while to inquire whether some of these can not be
dispensed with by devices which will suit the inquirer as
well or nearly as well. Such economies are mentioned in §§
<a href="#a7-093" title="to &#xa7; 93">93</a>–97,

“Handbook of <em class="embold">drawing</em> and <em class="embold">engraving.</em>”</p>

<p>But some of the subjects may be omitted if their treatment
is so slight that it is not worth while to take any notice
of them, which is occasionally the case even when they
are mentioned on the title-page. Sometimes an analytical
can take the place of a full entry for the less important
topics. The points to be considered are; (1) Would this
book be of any use to one who is looking up this subject?
(2) Is the entry or reference necessary as a subject-word
entry or reference (that is, to one who is looking for this
book)?</p>

<p>Some books are polytopical which do not appear to be so
at first sight. A collection of portraits of Germans,
for example, has the subject <em class="embold">Germans</em>, and so far
as it has any artistic value might be quoted as one of
the illustrative works under the subject <em class="embold">Portrait</em>
<em class="embold">painting</em> or <em class="embold">Portrait</em>
<em class="embold">engraving.</em>&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnanc45">[45]</a>
If the
biographical interest were all, the general collections
would be put under <em class="embold">Portraits</em> and the national
collections (as “American portrait gallery,” “Zwei
Hundert Bildnisse deutscher Männer”) under countries,
with references from the general heading to the various
countries, as directed in § <a href="#a7-097" title="to &#xa7; 97">97</a>. If the artistic interest
were alone considered, the general titles would be put
under <em class="embold">Portraits</em>, and collections by painters or
engravers of particular schools would be put under the
names of the schools; which would amount to nearly the same
arrangement as the previous.</p>

<p>So in regard to <em class="embold">Hymns</em>; there are three sources
of interest, the devotional, the literary (which would
lead to national subdivision), and the denominational;
a similar treatment would place general collections
under <em class="embold">Hymns</em>, collections in any language under
the national heading, with either double entry under the
name of the denomination or a reference from that to the
national heading, specifying which of the collections there
enumerated belong to the denomination. But the devotional
interest so decidedly preponderates that it has been
customary to collect everything under the form-heading
<em class="embold">Hymns.</em></p>

<p>In Full, almanacs will have form-entry under
<em class="embold">Almanacs</em> and subject-entry under the district about
which they give information.</p>

<p>Sometimes if an ordinary reference be made from one subject
to another the title referred to can not easily be found.
A reference from <em class="embold">Architecture</em> to <em class="embold">Spain.</em>
<i>Architecture</i>, is convenient, but a reference to the same
heading from <em class="embold">Gothic</em>
<em class="embold">architecture</em> is not, because
it obliges the inquirer to look through the whole list
of Spanish architecture to find perhaps one title on the
Gothic. In like manner there would be few entries of
works on vases under most countries, so that no division
<i>Vases</i> would be made, and the inquirer must search for
his book among a number of titles on <i>Art.</i> And if the
reference were made the other way—from the country to
<em class="embold">Vases</em>—the inquirer would be in the same plight.
There is no need, however, of double entry. If merely
the name of the particular author or authors referred to
under any subject be inserted in the reference, the whole
difficulty vanishes.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that herein Short has a great advantage;
it does not lose so much <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span> by double entry and can
afford to make it in many cases where Medium must for
economy put the reader to some trouble. The notes, too,
in such catalogues as the Quincy or the Boston Public
history-list afford a convenient way of briefly inserting
considerable double entry where it is thought expedient
without any apparent inconsistency.</p></div>

If a book purports to treat of several subjects,
which together make the whole or a great part of one more
general, it may be put either under each of the special
subjects, or under the general subject, and in the latter
case it may or may not have analytical references from the
specific subjects, according as the treatises are more or
less distinct and more or less important.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>E.</i> <i>g.</i>, “A treatise on anatomy, physiology, pathology, and
therapeutics,” which might be put under each of those four
headings, ought rather to be entered under <em class="embold">Medicine</em>,
in which case, if the separate parts are by different
authors, analyticals might very well be made under the
four headings; and at any rate an analytical under the
first would occasionally be useful as equivalent to a
subject-word reference.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-111" class="spa7">111</span>.
When a considerable number of books might all be
entered under the same two or more headings, entry under
one will be sufficient, with a reference from the others.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>On the other hand, if in printing it were noticed that
under any subject only one or two titles were covered by
the cross-references to countries (as from <em class="embold">Sculpture</em>
to <em class="embold">Greece</em>, <em class="embold">Italy</em>, <em class="embold">Denmark</em>), it may be
thought that double entry under nation and subject would be
preferable. A man is provoked if he turns to another part
of the catalogue to find there only one title. However, it
should be remembered that one or two titles repeated under
each of many subjects will amount to a considerable number
in the whole. The want of uniformity produced by this
mixture of reference and double entry is of less importance.</p></div>

When there are many editions of a book, it is
allowable to merely refer under the subject to the
author-entry. In a college library, for instance, the
full entry of all the editions of the classics under
their appropriate subjects (as of the Georgics under
<em class="embold">Agriculture</em>, of Thucydides under <em class="embold">Greek</em>
<em class="embold">history</em>, and Polybius under <em class="embold">Roman</em>
<em class="embold">history</em>)
would be a waste of room; it is enough to mention the best
edition and refer for other editions and translations to
the author’s name.</p>

The systematic catalogue undertakes to exhibit a
scientific arrangement of the books in a library in
the belief that it will thus best aid those who would
pursue any extensive or thorough study. The dictionary
catalogue sets out with another object and a different
method, but having attained that object—facility of
reference—is at liberty to try to secure some of the
advantages of classification and system in its own way.
Its subject-entries, individual, general, limited,
extensive, thrown together without any logical arrangement,
in most absurd proximity—<em class="embold">Abscess</em> followed by
<em class="embold">Absenteeism</em> and that by <em class="embold">Absolution</em>,
<em class="embold">Club-foot</em> next to <em class="embold">Clubs</em>, and <em class="embold">Communion</em>

<em class="embold">Theology</em>, <em class="embold">Bibliography</em> and <em class="embold">Literary</em>
<em class="embold">history</em> are separated by half the length of the
catalogue—are a mass of utterly disconnected particles
without any relation to one another, each useful in
itself but only by itself. But by a well-devised net-work
of cross-references the mob becomes an army, of which
each part is capable of assisting many other parts. The
effective force of the catalogue is immensely increased.
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span></p>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-119" class="spa7">119</span>.
Make references from general subjects to their
various subordinate subjects and also to coördinate and
illustrative subjects.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Cross-references should be made by Full from <em class="embold">Classes</em>
of persons (Merchants, Lawyers, Artists, Quakers, etc.) to
individuals belonging to those classes; from <em class="embold">Cities</em>
to persons connected with them by birth or residence, or at
least to those who have taken part in the municipal affairs
or rendered the city illustrious; from <em class="embold">Countries</em>
to their colonies, provinces, counties, cities, etc.
(unless their number is so great or the divisions are
so well known that reference is useless); also, under
the division <i>History</i> to rulers and statesmen, under
<i>Literature</i> to authors, under <i>Art</i> to artists, and so on;
from other <em class="embold">Subjects</em> to all their parts, and to the
names of persons distinguished for discoveries in them or
knowledge of them. Short and Medium will make such of these
references as seem most likely to be useful.</p>

<p>The construction of this system may be carried on
simultaneously with the ordinary cataloguing of the
library, each book as it goes through the cataloguer’s
hands not merely receiving its author- and subject-entries,
but also suggesting the appropriate cross-reference; but
when all the books are catalogued the system will not
be complete. References are needed not merely to the
specific from the general but to the general from the more
general and to that from the most general. There must be
a pyramid of references, and this can be made only by a
final revision after the completion of the cataloguing.
The best method is to draw off in a single column a list
of all the subject-headings that have been made, to write
opposite them their including classes in a second column
and the including classes of these in a third column; then
to write these classes as headings to cards and under them
the subjects that stood respectively opposite to them in
the list, to arrange the cards alphabetically, verify the
references, and supplement them by thinking of all likely
subordinate headings and ascertaining whether they are in
the catalogue, and also by considering what an inquirer
would like to be told or reminded of if he were looking up
the subject under consideration. In this way a reasonably
complete list may be made.</p>

<p>It will, however, often happen that there is no entry
under the including subject. Take a simple instance. The
catalogue, we will suppose, contains twenty histories of
towns belonging to seven counties in Connecticut. In the
revision described above references have been made both
from Connecticut <i>to</i> these counties and to the towns
<i>from</i> the counties, but only three of the counties have
any titles under them. The others would not make their
appearance in the catalogue at all if there were no
cross-references. And as this will happen continually,
it follows that the system will very greatly increase
the number of headings and therefore the length of the
catalogue. Such fullness may be allowable in regard to the
state which contains the library, which, of course, should
be treated with exceptional completeness. It may possibly
be worth while for all the States of the Union and for
England, but to attempt to do the same for all countries
and all subjects is too much. A modification of the plan
must be introduced which will make it much less complete
but still useful. With many subjects the next heading in
the ascending series must be skipped, and the references
massed under one still higher; in the supposed case, for
example, the references to all the towns will be made under
Connecticut and under those counties alone which have any
other entry under them.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-120" class="spa7">120</span>.
Make references occasionally from specific to general
subjects.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Of course much information about limited topics is to be
found in more general works; the very best description of
a single plant or of a family of plants may perhaps be
contained in a botanical encyclopædia. This fact, however,
must be impressed upon the inquirer in the preface of
the catalogue or in a printed card giving directions for
its use; it is out of the question to make all possible
references of the ascending kind. From <em class="embold">Cathedrals</em>,
for example, one would naturally refer to <em class="embold">Christian</em>
<em class="embold">art</em> and to <em class="embold">Ecclesiastical</em>
<em class="embold">architecture</em>, because
works on those subjects will contain more or less on
cathedrals. But so will histories of architecture and
<span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span> histories of English, French, German, or Spanish
architecture; so will travels in England, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain. And anyone who desired to take an absolutely
complete survey of the subject, or who was willing to spend
unlimited time in getting information on some detail, would
have to consult such books. Yet the cataloguer may very
excusably not think of referring to those subjects, or
if he thinks of it may deem the connection too remote to
justify reference, and that he should be overloading the
catalogue with what would be generally useless.</p>

<p>There are many things that are seldom used, and then
perhaps but for an instant, and yet their existence is
justified because when wanted they are indispensable, or
because they make useful what is otherwise useless: a
policy of insurance, life-preservers in a steamer, the
index of a book, large parts of the catalogue of a library,
among others the cross-references. Of such a nature, but
much less useful, more easily dispensed with, is a</p></div>

<span id="a7-122" class="spa7">122</span>.
Make a form-entry for collections of works in any form
of literature.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In the catalogues of libraries consisting chiefly of
English books, if it is thought most convenient to
make form-entries under the headings <em class="embold">Poetry</em>,
<em class="embold">Drama</em>, <em class="embold">Fiction</em>, it may be done, because for
those libraries Poetry is synonymous with English poetry,
and so on; but if a library has any considerable number
of books in foreign languages the national classification
should be strictly followed; that is to say, entries
should be made under <em class="embold">English</em>
<em class="embold">drama</em>, <em class="embold">English</em>
<em class="embold">fiction</em>, <em class="embold">English</em>
<em class="embold">poetry</em>, <em class="embold">Latin</em>
<em class="embold">poetry</em>,
etc.; only those collections of plays, novels, poems that
include specimens of several literatures being put under
<em class="embold">Drama</em>, <em class="embold">Fiction</em>, <em class="embold">Poetry.</em> Or the English
plays, novels, poems, etc., may be entered under Drama,
Fiction, Poetry, etc., and the dramatic works, etc.,
of foreign literatures under the names of the several
literatures.</p>

<p>The rule above confines itself to collections. It would
be convenient to have full lists of the single works in
the library in all the various kinds of literature, and
when space can be afforded they ought to be given; if
there is not room for them, references must be made under
these headings to the names of all the single authors;
an unsatisfactory substitute, it is true, but better
than entire omission. Note, however, that there is much
less need of these lists in libraries which give their
frequenters access to the shelves than where such access
is denied, so that borrowers must depend entirely on the
catalogue. In the case of English fiction a form-list is of
such constant use that nearly all libraries have separate
fiction catalogues.</p>

<p>It has been objected that such lists of novels, plays,
etc., do not suit the genius of the dictionary catalogue.
The objection is of no importance if true; if such lists
are useful they ought to be given. There is nothing in the
dictionary plan which makes them hard to use if inserted.
But the objection is not well founded. Under the names of
certain subjects we give lists of the authors who have
treated of those subjects; under the names of certain kinds
of literature we give lists of the authors who have written
books in those forms; the cases are parallel. The divisions
of fiction, it must be understood, are not the authors
who have written novels but the different kinds of novels
which they have written; they are either such varieties as
“Historical fiction,” “Sea stories,” “Religious novels,”
or such as “English fiction,” “French fiction.” The first
divisions we do not make for single works because it would
be very difficult to do so and of little use; but if there
were collections in those classes we should certainly
introduce such headings. The second division (by language)
is made as it is in Poetry and Drama, both for single works
and collections. <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span> </p>

<p>There is no reason but want of room why only collections
should be entered under form-headings. The first entries of
collections were merely title-entries, and Mr. Crestadoro
is the only person who has thought that plays, etc.,
deserve two title-entries, one from the first word, the
other from what we might call the form-word. It is not
uninteresting to watch the steps by which the fully
organized quadruple syndetic dictionary catalogue is
gradually developing from the simple subject-word index.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">

<p>Thus an agricultural dictionary will not be entered under

it would be well to jumble together, under a form-heading,
<em class="embold">Grammars</em> or <em class="embold">Dictionaries</em>, all grammars and
lexicons in all languages. Those who inquire so vaguely
must be made to state their wishes more definitely. The
cataloguer does his part if he inserts a note under such
headings explanatory of the practice of the catalogue; as</p>

treatises or vague essays are much harder to classify and
much less valuable for analysis. In analyzing collections
of essays original articles should be brought out in
preference to reviews, which are commonly not worth
touching (except in a very full catalogue) either under
the author of the work reviewed or under its subject. Of
course exception may be made for famous reviews or for good
reviews of famous works. A work giving a careful literary
estimate of an author may be an exception to this remark;
reviews of the “Works” of any author are most likely to
contain such an estimate. Many reviews, like Macaulay’s,
are important for their treatment of the subject and not
worth noticing under the book reviewed, which is merely a
pretext for the article.</p></div>

headings than to make the second analytical. <i>Ex.</i> A “Short
account of the application to Parliament by the merchants
of London, with the substance of the evidence as summed
up by Mr. Glover,” is to be entered under <em class="embold">London.</em>
<i>Merchants</i>, as first author, but as Glover’s part is
two-thirds of the whole, it should also be entered under
him, the entry in each case being made full enough not to
mislead.</p></div>

In analyticals it is well to give the date of the
book referred to and also, though less necessary, to state
the pages which contain the article. Many readers will not
notice these details, but they will do no one any harm and
will assist the careful student.</p>

<h3 class="h3m">VI. STYLE.</h3>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-129" class="spa7">129</span>.
Uniformity for its own sake is of very little account;
for the sake of intelligibility, to prevent perplexity and
misunderstanding, it is worth something. And it is well to
be uniform, merely to avoid the question, “Why were you not
consistent?” <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span></p>

<h4 class="h4m">A. HEADINGS.</h4>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-130" class="spa7">130</span>.
Print headings in some marked type.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Either heavy-faced (best, if it can be had not too black),
small capitals (handsome), or italics (least pleasing);
never capitals (ugly and hard to read). Christian names
should be in ordinary type; to make them like the heading
is confusing, to have a special type for them would be
extravagant.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-131" class="spa7">131</span>.
Italicize titles of honor and similar distinguishing
words.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Earl</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Rev.</i>, <i>of</i> <i>Paris</i>, <i>Alexandrinus</i>, etc.,
also the name of a country or state following the name of a
town, as Wilton, <i>N.</i> <i>H.</i>, Cambridge, <i>Eng.</i>
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/index.261e.png"
width="74" height="82" alt="☞" />&#x202f;These</span> words
are to be italicized only in the headings and not in the
title. They are italicized in the heading to distinguish
the name and bring it out clearly; there is no need of such
distinction in titles. Do not print <em class="embold">Badeau</em>, <i>Gen.</i>
A. Life of <i>Gen.</i> Grant. If the heading is italicized, the
words <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Earl</i>, etc., must be distinguished from it
in some other way.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-132" class="spa7">132</span>.
Print the headings of all the four kinds of entry
(author, title, subject, form) in the same kind of type.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In some indexes a distinction is made between persons and
places or between authors and subjects, but in a catalogue
varieties of type must be reserved for more important
distinctions. The Catalogue of the Library of the Interior
Department uses a heavy-faced title type for authors
and a light-faced antique for other entries, with very
satisfactory effect; but such typographical luxuries are
not within general reach.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-133" class="spa7">133</span>.
Print the whole of an author-, title-, or form-heading
in the special type; also an alternative family name and
the family name of the second of joint authors, if both
authors are put into the heading (§ <a href="#a7-240" title="to &#xa7; 240">240</a>), and the family
names of British noblemen.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Cervantes</em>

<em class="embold">Manchester</em>, W. Drogo <em class="embold">Montagu</em>, <i>7th Duke</i> <i>of.</i></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-134" class="spa7">134</span>.
Print the first word of a title-entry in the special
type.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Rough</em>
diamond. But compound words, whether hyphened
or not, should be printed wholly in the
heading type; as, <em class="embold">Out
of door</em> <span
class="wdspa">amusements. London,&#x2005;1864.
8º.</span> This is merely for looks; the kind of type
has nothing to do with the arrangement.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-135" class="spa7">135</span>.
Add <i>pseud.</i> to the heading for all sorts of false
names of whatever origin.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>So much is necessary to prevent mistake on the part of
the public; but it is a waste of time for the cataloguer
to rack his brains to discover which of the ingenious
names invented by Pierquin de Gembloux (cryptonym, geonym,
phrenonym, etc.) is applicable to each case; for the only
result is that readers are puzzled. A list of these terms
may be found in the Notice of Quérard by Olphar Hamst [<i>i.
e.</i>, R. Thomas], London, 1867.</p>

<p>The unauthorized assumption of any name should
be indicated by such phrases as <i>called</i>, <i>calling</i>
<i>himself</i>, <i>dit</i>, <i>soi disant</i>, <i>se</i> <i>dicente</i> or <i>che
si</i> <i>dice</i>, <i>que se</i> <i>dice</i> or <i>se</i> <i>dicendiose</i>,
<i>genannt</i>, <i>genoemd</i>, etc.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-136" class="spa7">136</span>.
When an author uses a single pseudonym add it to his
name, unless the entry is made under the pseudonym; when
the pseudonym is used only in one work, and different ones
in other works, include it in that title, followed by
[<i>pseud.</i>].</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p class="spitalic">Ex.</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Clemens</em>, S. C.
(<i>pseud.</i> Mark <em class="embold">Twain</em>).</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Godwin</em>, <span class="wdspa">Wm.
The</span> looking-glass; by T. Marcliffe [<i>pseud.</i>]. <span
class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-137" class="spa7">137</span>.
Add <i>ed.</i> to the heading when it is needed to show
that a book is merely put together, not written, by the
author in hand.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>The title usually shows this fact clearly enough without
<i>ed.</i> Short would omit to note the fact, and in Full,
perhaps even in Medium, it is better to state it in the
title than in the heading. The distinction, after all, is
rarely of practical value.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-138" class="spa7">138</span>.
Repeat the family name for each person.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p class="spitalic">Ex.</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Smith</em>, <span class="wdspa">Caleb. Sermon.</span></p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—, <span class="wdspa">Conrad. Narrative.</span></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-139" class="spa7">139</span>.
Distinguish authors whose family name is the same by
giving the forename in full or by initials.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In a card catalogue the names should always be given in
full; in printing, initials are often used to save room;
but the saving is small, and the advantages of full names
are so considerable that any cataloguer who is relieved
from the necessity of the greatest possible compression
ought to give them. For the more common forenames fullness
can be combined with economy by the use of the colon
abbreviations (C:&nbsp;=&nbsp;Charles, etc. See Appendix V.) Under
subjects it is rare that two persons of even the same
family name come together and initials are sufficient; but
here also the colon initials should be used. An exception
may well be made in the case of men always known by a
double name; as, Sydney Smith or Bayard Taylor. Nobody
talks of Smith or Taylor. <em class="embold">Taylor</em>, B., conveys no
idea whatever to most readers. <em class="embold">Taylor</em>, Bayard,
they know. When one name alone is usual, as Gladstone,
Shakespeare, and when both forms are used, as Dickens and
Charles Dickens, initials will suffice. Of course there
can be no uniformity in such practice, but there will be
utility, which is better.</p>

<p>Forenames used by the author in a diminutive or otherwise
varied form may be given in that form.</p>

<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Carleton</em>, Will; <em class="embold">McLean</em>, Sally;
<em class="embold">Reuter</em>, Fritz.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-140" class="spa7">140</span>.
Mark in some way those forenames which are usually
omitted by the author, and neglect them in the arrangement.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <em class="embold">Collins</em>, (Wm.) Wilkie; <em class="embold">Gérard</em>, (Cécile)
Jules (Basile). This is of practical use. The consulter
running over the Collinses is puzzled by the unusual
name unless some generally accepted sign shows him that
it is unusual. He does not quickly recognize Charles
Dickens in <em class="embold">Dickens</em>, Charles John Huffam; or Leigh
Hunt in <em class="embold">Hunt</em>, James Henry Leigh; or Max Müller in
<em class="embold">Müller</em>, Friedrich Max. Besides, the eye finds the
well-known name more quickly if the others are, as it
were, pushed aside. The most common methods of distinction
are inclosure in parentheses and spacing: <em class="embold">Guizot</em>,
(François Pierre) Guillaume, or <em class="embold">Guizot</em>,
F&#x202f;r&#x202f;a&#x202f;n&#x202f;ç&#x202f;o&#x202f;i&#x202f;s &#x202f;P&#x202f;i&#x202f;e&#x202f;r&#x202f;r&#x202f;e Guillaume. The latter is
objec­tion­able as unusual, as taking too much room, and as
making emphatic the very part of the name which one wants
to hide. I prefer the style, <em class="embold">Dickens</em>, Charles (<i>in
full</i> C: J: Huffam). <i>See</i> § <a href="#a7-221" title="to &#xa7; 221">221</a>. But in those catalogues
in which all Christian names are inclosed in parentheses,
some other sign must of course be used to mark the less
usual names.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-141" class="spa7">141</span>.
Distinguish authors whose family and forenames are the
same by the dates of their birth and death, or, if these
are not known, by some other label.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p><i>Ex.</i> <i>Bp.</i>, <i>C.</i> <i>E.</i>, <i>Capt.</i>, <i>Col.</i>, <i>D.D.</i>, <i>F.R.S.</i>,
etc., always to be printed in italics.</p>

<p>In a manuscript catalogue, in preparing which of course one
never knows how many new names may be added, such titles
should be given to every name. In <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span> printing, if room
is an object, they may be omitted except when needed for
the distinction of synonymous authors. Note, however, that
many persons are commonly known and spoken of by a title
rather than by their first name, and it is a convenience
for the man who is looking, for instance, for the life of
Gen. Greene, whose Christian name he does not know, to see
at once, as he runs his eye over the list of Greenes, which
are generals, without having to read all the titles of
books written by or about the Greenes in order to identify
him. For the same reason <i>Mrs.</i> should always be given
with the name of a married woman, whether the forename
which follows is her own or her husband’s; even when the
following form is adopted, “<em class="embold">Hall</em>, <i>Mrs.</i> Anna Maria
(Fielding), <i>wife</i> <i>of</i> S. C.,” which is always to be done
when in her titles she uses her husband’s initials. In this
case a reference should be made from <em class="embold">Hall</em>, <i>Mrs.</i> S.
C., to <em class="embold">Hall</em>, <i>Mrs.</i> <em class="embold">A.</em>
<em class="embold">M.</em>, and so in similar
cases. If forenames are represented under subjects by their
initials, it is well to give <i>Miss</i> or <i>Mrs.</i> with the
names of female authors. The reader who would like to read
a book by Miss Cobbe on a certain subject may not feel sure
that <em class="embold">Cobbe, F.</em>
<em class="embold">P.</em>, is <em class="embold">Miss</em> Cobbe.</p>

<p>As late as 1760 unmarried women were usually styled
<i>Mrs.</i>; as, Mrs. Lepel, Mrs. Woffington, Mrs. Blount, and
among writers Mrs. Hannah More. There is no objection to
following this practice in cataloguing, as the object of
the cataloguer is not to furnish biographical information
but to identify the people catalogued.</p></div>

Titles of Englishwomen are to be treated by the
following rules:&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn47" id="fnanc47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="pa7a">In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries
above her own rank she takes her husband’s title in
exchange for her own, if below her own rank she keeps her
own title.</p>

<p class="ph7m">Titles of married women.</p>

<p class="pa7a"><i>a.</i> The wife of a peer takes her husband’s style.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness, etc. In
cataloguing, say <em class="embold">Brassey</em>, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness;
not <em class="embold">Brassey</em>, Annie (Allnutt), <i>Lady.</i></p></div>

<p class="pa7a"><i>b.</i> The wife of a knight or baronet is Lady. Whether this
title precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether
she had a title before her marriage.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (either
knight or baronet), she is Lady Mary Brown, also if Hon.
Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet) she
is Lady Mary Brown; but if Miss Mary Smith marries Sir John
Brown (knight or baronet), she becomes Mary, Lady Brown.</p></div>

<p class="pa7a"><i>c.</i> A maid of honor retains her Hon. after marriage,
unless, of course, it is merged into a higher title.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Lady
Brown, if a peer the Lady So and So, in either case as
though she had been a peer’s daughter.</p></div>

<p class="pa7a"><i>d.</i> The wife of an earl’s (or higher peer’s) younger son
is never the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Lady; if she used the Lady before
marriage in her own right she does not, of course, add
anything by such marriage, but the wife of a younger son of
a lower peer than an earl is Hon<sup>ble</sup> Mrs. (not Lady)—the
younger children of all peers using, of course, the family
name, with or without their forenames, according to their
rank. <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span> </p>

<p class="pa7a"><i>e.</i> If the lady to whom the title Hon. belongs in virtue
of her father’s rank marries a commoner, she retains her
title, becoming Hon. Lady, if she marries a knight or
baronet; and Hon. Mrs., if her husband has no title.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>None of these courtesy titles are inherited by the children
of those who bear them, the third generation of even the
highest peer being simply commoners unless raised in rank
by marriage or merit.</p></div>

<p class="ph7m">Titles of unmarried women.</p>

<p class="pa7a"><i>f.</i> The title Lady belongs to daughters of all noblemen
not lower than earl.</p>

<p class="pa7a"><i>g.</i> The title Hon. belongs to daughters of viscounts and
barons; also to an untitled woman who becomes maid of honor
to the Queen, and this title is retained after she leaves
the service. If a woman who has the title Lady becomes maid
of honor she does not acquire the title Hon.</p>

Magenta</i>, <i>Bishop of</i> <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>évêque de</i> <i>Meaux</i>; but
<i>Emperor of</i> <i>Germany</i>, <i>King of</i> <i>France</i>, not <i>Kaiser</i> and
<i>roi</i>, because names of sovereign princes are given in
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually

<i>Alexandrinus.</i></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-144" class="spa7">144</span>.
Prefixes (<i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, titles which in speaking come
before the name), as, <i>Hon.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Rev.</i>, etc., should
be placed before the Christian name (as <em class="embold">Smith</em>,
<i>Capt.</i> John), and suffixes as <i>Jr.</i>, <i>D.D.</i>, <i>LL.D.</i>,
after it (as <em class="embold">Channing</em>, James Ellery, <i>D.D.</i>).</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name,
as <em class="embold">Derby</em>, Thomas <em class="embold">Stanley</em>, 1<i>st</i> <i>Earl</i> <i>of</i>;
but British courtesy titles (<i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, those given to
the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede, as
<em class="embold">Wellesley</em>, <i>Lord</i> Charles (2d son of the Duke of
Wellington). In other languages than English, French,
and German the title usually precedes the forename; as,
<em class="embold">Alfieri</em>, <i>Conte</i> Vittorio. Occasionally a French
nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames;
as, <em class="embold">Gasparin</em>, <i>Comte</i> Agénor de.</p>

<p><i>Lord</i> should be replaced by the exact title in the names
of English noblemen, <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, Lord Macaulay should be
entered as <em class="embold">Macaulay</em>, 1<i>st</i> <i>Baron.</i> <i>Lord</i> in
the title of Scotch judges follows the family name; as,
<em class="embold">Kames</em>, H. <em class="embold">Home</em>, <i>afterwards</i> <i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>The title Baronet is given in the form <em class="embold">Scott</em>, <i>Sir</i>
Walter, <i>Bart.</i></p>

<p>Patronymic phrases, as <i>of</i> <i>Dedham</i>, follow all the names;
but they must immediately follow the family name when
they are always used in close connection with it, as
<em class="embold">Girault</em> <i>de St.</i> <i>Farjeau</i>, Eusèbe; similarly <i>aîné</i>,
<i>fils</i>, <i>jeune</i>, as <em class="embold">Dumas</em> <i>fils</i>, Alexandre;
<em class="embold">Didot</em> <i>fils</i>, Ambroise. Latin appellatives should
not in general be separated from their nouns by a comma;

The more careful and student-like the probable use of
the library the fuller the title should be,—fuller,
that is, of information, not of words. Many a title
a yard long does not convey as much meaning as two
well-chosen words. No precise rule can be given for
abridgment. The title must not be so much shortened
that the book shall be confounded with any other book
of the same author or any other edition of the same
book, or that it shall fail to be recognized by those
who know it or have been referred to it by title, or
that it shall convey a false or insufficient idea of
the nature of the work and (under the subject) of its
theme and its <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
method of treating its theme.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn49" id="fnanc49">[49]</a> On the other hand,
it must not retain anything which could reasonably

This clause must be very differently
interpreted according to the character of the catalogue.
It expresses rather the object to be aimed at than the
point which an ordinary catalogue can expect to reach. To
fully describe and characterize every book is impossible
for most cataloguers. Still by a little management much may
be briefly done. The words drama, play, novel, historical
novel, poem, retained from or inserted in the title tell a
great deal in a little space.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc50" id="fn50">[50]</a>
It must make these omissions not merely
that the catalogue may be short but that consulting it
may be easy. Other things being equal, that title is best
which can be taken in at a glance. What has been said in
defence of full titles may be true, that “it takes longer
to abridge a title than to copy it in full,” but it is
also true that it takes longer for the printer to set the
unabridged title, and longer for the reader to ascertain
its meaning, and a long-title catalogue, besides being more
expensive, is more bulky and therefore less convenient.</p></div>

is slightly different, and “Kiss in the dark” might be
taken for an injunction, whereas “A kiss in the dark” is
evidently only a title. Still neither Short nor Medium
should hesitate to omit even in these cases. Besides the
economy, the alphabetical order is brought out more clearly
by this omission. That can also be done awkwardly by
transposing the article; as,</p>

not merely allowed, but required. It may be possible to
increase the number of cataloguing signs. We have now 8º

N. Y. for New York, L. for London, P. for Paris, etc., as

Abbreviate certain common words always, and less
common words in a long title which can not be shortened in
any other way.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Abbreviations should suggest the word for which they are
used, and should not, if it can be avoided, suggest any
other. When one abbreviation is used for two words, if
the context does not determine the sense the abbreviation
must be lengthened. The most common and useful are Abp.

<p>The preface of an excellent catalogue remarks that “the
primary object of subject-entries is to inform the reader
<i>who</i> have written upon a given topic rather than <i>what</i>
has been written.” This is a mistake. The inquirer wishes
to know both; in fact he wants to know who have written
about it because their character will suggest to him what
they have written. <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span></p></div>

Retain in the author entry the first words of the
title; let the abridgement be made farther on.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Because (1) it facilitates library work, by rendering the
identification of the book quicker and surer; (2) if there
is no part of the title which must be given, two persons
may abridge so differently that not a single word shall be
the same in the two abridged titles, so that two works will
be made out of one (I have often known this to happen); (3)
books are frequently referred to by the first word of the
title (Grassi’s “Notizie sullo stato presente degli Stati
Uniti” may be quoted as Grassi: Notizie). Short, however,
can probably not afford to retain first words in all cases.
Half the phrases used at the beginning of titles add
little or nothing to the meaning, such as “Treatise on,”
“System of,” “Series of lectures on,” “Practical hints on
the quantitative pronunciation of Latin” (here “Practical
hints” belongs in the preface, not in the title, to which
it really adds nothing whatever). “History of” must often
be retained under the subject. One can say</p>

<p class="pexc">
<span class="smcap">Y<b>OUNG</b>,</span> <i>Sir</i> <span class="wdspa">W.
Athens. 3d&#x2005;ed. London,</span> 1804;</p>

<p class="pcontinue">but under <i>Athens</i> that would not be enough; it would be
necessary to write</p>

<p class="pexc">
<span class="smcap">Y<b>OUNG</b>,</span> <i>Sir</i> <span class="wdspa">W.
History</span> of Athens,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">to distinguish it from such works as Stuart’s “Antiquities
of Athens,” and Leake’s “Topography of Athens.” But if
there are enough titles under Athens to admit of the
subheadings <i>Art</i>, <i>Antiquities</i>, <i>History</i>, the words
“History of” again become unnecessary. Medium ought always
to retain first words under author, and <i>may</i> omit them
under subject; but such phrases as “Manual of,” “Lectures
on,” do much to explain the character of the book, and for
that reason ought often to be retained.</p>

<p>Mottoes, however, at the top of the title-page (often
separated by a line from the real title) may be neglected.
Sometimes such superscriptions are important, generally not.</p>

<p>When the author’s name alone or his name and titles
are first on the title-page, as is frequently the
case in old Latin and modern French books, omit <span
class="wdspa">them. <i>Example</i>:</span> Jani Jacobi
Boissardi Vesuntini de divinatione.</p>

<p>A custom has grown up of late, particularly in French
publications, of putting at the top of the title-page,
before the title proper, the name of the series to
which the work belongs or else what might be called the
classification of the book. The name of the series should
be given in parentheses after the imprint. The cataloguer
may retain or omit the classification at his discretion.

omission of these words by&nbsp;...</p></div>

The use of ... is suited only to

a substitute for the book itself and must leave some
questions to be answered by the latter. But if the ... are
used they should be printed as a group, separated from the

London,</span> 1738, <span class="wdspa">33. 2&#x202f;v. O.</span></p>

<p>The specification of edition is necessary: (1) for the
student, who often wants a particular edition and cares no
more for another than he would for an entirely different
work; (2) in the library service, to prevent the rejection
of works which are not really duplicates. And the number of
the edition is a fact in the literary history of the author

merely of place, date, form, and number of volumes
(Wash., <span class="wdspa">1875. 2&#x202f;v.
O).</span> The other details are given by Medium in
particular cases. Full gives them always, but it may
be doubted whether their use is frequent enough to
pay for the very considerable increase in the trouble
of cataloguing. It is worth while to show by some
sign (as <i>pm.</i>) that the pages are less than 100 or
than 50 (40 is the limit of the French Bibliothèque
Nationale), for the fact is easily ascertained, and
the mark fills little space and may prevent some one
sending for a book he does not care to look at. It is
not an exact designation, but many things are useful
which are not exact. On the other hand an inquirer
might occasionally fail to see the best treatise
on his subject, thinking it too short to be of any
value. Neither Short nor Medium should give the exact
number of maps, plates, etc., but it is well worth
while, especially for a popular library, to add the
word <i>illus.</i> to the titles of books in which the
illustrations are at all prominent, and, under <em
class="embold">Biography</em>, to note the presence of
portraits.</p>

<p>Imprints are indispensable in a catalogue designed for
scholars, that is for college libraries, for historical
or scientific libraries, and for large city libraries.
They may not be of much use to nine persons in ten who
use those libraries, but they should be inserted for the
tenth person. But in the majority of popular city and town
libraries neither the character of the readers nor of
the books justifies their insertion. Their place may be
much better filled (as in the Quincy catalogue) with more
important matter—with “<i>Illus.</i>” or “<i>Portraits</i>,” or a
word or two explaining an obscure title. But the number
of volumes should invariably be given. And the year of
publication is important under subjects.</p>

<p>Epithets like “Large paper,” which are applicable,
generally, to only a part of the copies of a book, should
be mentioned after all the details which apply to the whole
edition (place, date, number of volume, etc.).</p></div>

<p>When the subarrangement of the catalogue is by
dates (as in that of the Amer. Philos. Society), it
may be well to place the date uniformly at the end
of the line in this order: <span class="wdspa">O.

put the place and date immediately after the title,
because like it they are taken from the title-page.
The form, which is not copied but is the cataloguer’s
own assertion, then comes last. The dates can be made
prominent in a chronological arrangement by printing
them in heavy type, as in Prof. Abbot’s “Literature
of the doctrine of a future life.” In Very Short the
German style of printing dates should be adopted,
742 (<i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, 1742), 875 (<i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, 1875). <span

<p>7 v. O means Vol. 1–7 if nothing is said to the contrary,
and any number of missing volumes can be enumerated in
the second of these forms; but as the first volumes of
periodicals are often missing, the exception may be made
of always cataloguing them in the first form. Whatever
Short may be forced to do by its system of charging books,
Medium and Full ought to give the number of volumes
bibliographically, that is to say, they should count
only that a volume which has its own title, paging, and
register. If the parts of a work have a continuous register
or a continuous paging they form one volume; but if they
are called Vol. 1, Vol. 2 on the title-page they may be
described as 1 v. in 2. For the bibliographical cataloguer
binding has nothing to do with the matter. That the binder
has joined two or more thin volumes or divided a thick
one ought to be recorded in the accessions-book and in
the shelf-list, but is not worth notice in the catalogue;
if mentioned at all it should be in such a way that the
description of the accidental condition of a single copy in
a particular library shall not be mistaken for an assertion
applicable to a whole edition (thus, 1 v. bd. in 2, or
2 v. bd. in 1, as the case may be). A work which has a
title-page, but is connected with another work by mention
on its title-page as part of the volume, or by continuous
paging or register, is said to be <i>appended</i> to that work.</p></div>

<span id="a7-196" class="spa7">196</span>.
Let the signs fº, 4º, 8º, etc., if used, represent the
fold of the sheet as ascertained from the signature, not be
guessed from the size.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>In the older books this is important, and in
modern books the distinction between the octavo
and the duodecimo series is so easily ascertained
that it is not worth while <span class="xxpn"
id="p077">{77}</span> to be inaccurate. The size
may be more exactly indicated, if it is thought
worth while, by l. or sm., sq., obl., prefixed to
the fold, as l. 8º, sm. 4º. The “vo” or “mo” should
be represented by a superior º if it can be had,
otherwise a degree-mark °, though manifestly improper,
must be employed; it has abundant usage in its
favor.</p>

<p>Another method of giving the form is fº (8), 4º (2), 8º
(4), in which fº, 4º, 8º indicate the apparent form of
the book as the terms folio, quarto, octavo are generally
understood, and the figures within the parentheses show
the number of leaves intervening between the successive
signatures.</p>

<p>“In the folio the sheet of paper makes two leaves or four
pages, in the 4º four leaves, in the 8º eight, in the
12º twelve, and so on. When a sheet of paper is folded
into six leaves, making what ought to be a 6º book, it
is called a 12º printed in half sheets, because such
printing is always done with half-sized paper, or with
half-sheets, so as to give a 12º size. From a very early
period it has been universal to distinguish the sheets by
different letters called signatures. At present a sheet
has A on the first leaf or A1 on the first leaf and A2 on
the second, which is enough for the folder’s purpose. But
in former times the signatures were generally carried on
through half the sheet, and sometimes through the whole.
Again, in modern times, no sheet ever goes into and forms
part of another; that is, no leaf of any one sheet ever
lies between two leaves of another. But in the sixteenth
century, and even later in Italy, it was common enough to
print in quire-fashion, the same letter being used for the
whole quire, and the leaves of the quire distinguished as
they were successively placed inside of one another by the
figures 2, 3, 4, so that a book actually printed in folio
might have the signatures of a modern octavo. In exact
bibliography such books are sometimes described as ‘folio
in twos,’ ‘folio in fours.’ Rules are given for determining
the form of printing by the water-lines of the paper and by
the catchwords. It is supposed that the latter are always
at the end of the sheet, and also that the water-lines are
perpendicular in folio, octavo, and decimo-octavo books,
horizontal in quarto and duodecimo. But in the first place
a great many old books have catchwords at the bottom of
every page, many have none at all; and as to the rule of
water-lines, there are exceptions to every case of
it.”&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnanc62">[62]</a></p></div>

<p>For anything but exact bibliographical
description it is better to take no account of
the fold of the sheet, but either to give the
size in centimeters or to use the notation of
the American Library Association (see <span

<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc64" id="fn64">[64]</a>
Only Full can give the contents of all such
works, including the memoirs, transactions, etc., of all
the learned societies. And in an analytical catalogue this
is much less important. When every separate treatise is
entered in its proper places under the names of its author
and of its subject, why should it be given again in a long
column of fine type which few persons will ever read?
Because, if analysis is not complete, contents supplement
it; and one who has forgotten author and subject may
occasionally recall them by looking over a “<i>contents</i>;”
and this list is, so far as it goes, a substitute for
a classed catalogue in this respect. Moreover, the
“<i>contents</i>” is needed to fully explain the character of
the subject-entry (see § <a href="#a7-004" title="to &#xa7; 4">4</a>). In the division <i>Biography</i>
under countries we have many such titles as “Memoirs of
eminent Englishwomen,” “British senators,” “Political
portraits.” It is an advantage to the reader, though
perhaps neither a great nor a frequent advantage, to be
able to find out from the catalogue what Englishwomen and
what British senators he shall find described in the books.
No catalogue can be considered complete that omits such
information.</p>


<p>For collected works of any author “<i>contents</i>” have
been found so useful that even Short often gives them,
especially of late, and strange to say, not rarely prints
them in the most extravagant style, allowing a line for
each item. One may sometimes see a quarter of a page left
bare from this cause.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-199" class="spa7">199</span>.
When a single work fills several volumes give the
contents under the author, provided the division is
definite and easily described.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Object, that the inquirer may know which volume he wants;
application, chiefly to dictionaries and historical
works; method, in general, giving dates and letters of
the alphabet, which take little room. It is particularly
important also to fully describe in this way very bulky
works; Walton’s Polyglott is a good example, in consulting
which, without such a guide, one may have to handle ten
gigantic folios.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-200" class="spa7">200</span>.
Under the subject repeat so much of the contents as is
necessary to show how the subject is treated or what part
is treated in the different volumes.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>This is particularly desirable in works with an
insufficiently descriptive title which treat of several
subjects, for which under each heading will be given its
appropriate part of the contents. For example, Hugo’s
“Jus civile Antejustinianeum” contains the originals of
Antejustinian law, but this does not appear from its title,
and if it did, it would be hardly worth while to save a
few lines by obliging the reader to turn to <em class="embold">Hugo</em> to
ascertain just what is in the book. On the other hand, the
contents of Pertz’s “Monumenta Germaniae historica” is so
long that only Fullest can afford to give it under Germany
as well as under Pertz. In such a case the reader feels it
to be more reasonable that he should be referred.</p>

<p>The contents is often more useful under subject-heading
than under author; but it is best that there should be one
uniform place where it can always be found, and where the
whole of it can be found, and that place should be the
author-catalogue.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-201" class="spa7">201</span>.
Put into notes (in small type) that information which
is not given in the title but is required to be given by
the plan of the catalogue. <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span> </p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Notes have several objects:</p>

<p>1. To give any information about the author, the form
of his name, his pseudonyms, etc., about the different
editions or places of publication, or about the gaps in a
set (especially of periodicals), which can not be included
in the title without making it disproportionately long.
Short, especially if without imprints, can get many of
these into the title; which it is well to do, for a short
note is not economical.</p>

<p>2. To explain the title or correct any misapprehension to
which it might lead. In a popular library the boys take
out “The cruise of the Betsy,” imagining it to be another
“Cruise of the Midge.”</p>

<p>3. To direct the attention of persons not familiar with
literature to the best books. The main principles of such
annotating are simple. (<i>a.</i>) The notes should characterize
the best books only; to insert them under every author
would only confuse and weary; if few they will arrest
attention much better. Dull books and morally bad books
should be left in obscurity. Under some of the poorer works
which have attained unmerited popularity a brief protest
may be made; it will probably be ineffectual; but it can do
no harm to call Mühlbach unreliable or Tupper commonplace.
(<i>b.</i>) They should be brief and pointed. Perhaps after this
direction it is necessary to add that they should be true.</p>

<p>4. To lay out courses of reading for that numerous class
who are desirous of “improving their minds,” and are
willing to spend considerable effort and time but know
neither where to begin or how to go on.</p>

<p>5. To state what is the practice of the catalogue in
the entry of the publications of Congress, Parliament,
Academies, Societies, etc., the notes to be made under
those words.</p></div>

exception.</li>

<li>9. (Titles) in <i>German</i> and <i>Danish</i>, but not in the

<li>7. Société de l’Histoire de France.</li>

<li>8. Le Moyen Âge, la Révolution Française, Die französische
Revolution. The French, however, now generally print
le moyen âge, la révolution française. Capitals are to
be avoided, because in the short sentences of which a
catalogue consists they confuse rather than help the eye.
For this reason it is better not to capitalize names
in natural history whether English or Latin (bee, rana
pipiens, liliaceæ, etc.). Several libraries following the
lead of the Congress catalogue have discarded capitals
for German nouns. Grimm’s authority is alleged in
justification, but Grimm’s example is followed by a very
small minority even of German scholars, and the titles
so printed still have an awkward look to most readers.
The Boston Public Library also goes to an extreme in its
avoidance of capitals, not using them for such proper names
as methodists, protestant episcopal church, royal society,
etc.</li></ul>

<p>The names of languages are not to be capitalized in the
Romance languages, as “traduit de l’anglais,” “in francese.”</p>

<p>Titles of honor are not to be capitalized in the Romance
languages, as <i>comte</i>, <i>conte</i>, <i>marchese.</i> But <i>Monsieur</i>,
<i>Madame</i>, <i>Signor</i>, <i>Don</i>, <i>Donna</i> always begin with
capitals.</p>

<p>Use capitals (or, better, small capitals)
for numbers after the names of kings (Charles
<span class="smmaj">III.</span> or Henry <span
class="smmaj">IV.</span>) and for single-letter
abbreviations (A. D., B. C., H. M. S., F. R. S. E., etc.,
or <span class="smmaj">A. D.,</span> <span class="smmaj">F.
R. S. E.,</span> etc.). But n. p. no place, n. t. p. no
title-page, may be in lower-case letters or small capitals,
and b. born, d. died, ms. manuscript, should be in lower
case.</p></div> </div><!--section-->

<p>Separate by a&nbsp;; the title proper from the phrase relating
to the editor, translator, etc. This requires a minimum of
capitals. It will occasionally happen that the title can
not be thrown into one sentence, but that should always be
done when possible. It is usual to separate 4 and 5. The
French, however, make one sentence of them (Paris, 1864,
in–12). This has the advantage of agreeing with the best
form of quoting a title (“see his Memoirs, London, 1874,
O. in which,” etc.). It is useless for one who abridges
titles to make any attempt to follow the punctuation. The
spelling should be retained, but it is hardly worth while
for Short or Medium to imitate the old printers in their
indiscriminate use of i and j, u and v.</p>

<p>A library may have a collection of books or a few volumes
which from their rarity deserve to be catalogued with
every bibliographical nicety, with the most exact copying
of punctuation, spelling, and forms of letters, and even
with marks to show where the lines of the title end. Such
collections are the Prince and the Ticknor books in the
Boston Public Library, such single books are fifteeners
or the rarest Americana. Yet it may be questioned whether
a library does well to redescribe books already fully
described by Hain, Harrisse, Thiele, Trömmel, Stevens, or
Sabin. A simple reference to these works will generally
suffice (§ <a href="#a7-261" title="to &#xa7; 261">261</a>).</p></div>

<i>Mrs.</i>, or to suffixes, as <i>D.D.</i>, <i>F.R.S.</i>, <i>LL.D.</i>, etc.
In regard to <i>Hungarian</i> names, observe that the name
appears on the title-page as it does in a catalogue, the
family name first, followed by the Christian name; as,
“Elbeszélések; irta báró <em class="embold">Eötvös</em> Jozsef.”</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-220" class="spa7">220</span>.
When the forenames are the same arrange
chronologically.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Again, no attention is to be paid to the titles <i>Sir</i>, etc.
The alphabetical principle is of no use here because no one
can know beforehand which of many possible titles we have
taken to arrange by, whereas some one may know when the
author whom he is seeking lived. Of course</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Brown, T.</em>
  <em class="embold">L.</em>, comes before</p>
<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Brown</em>, Thomas, for the same reason that</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Browne.</em></p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-221" class="spa7">221</span>.
Forenames not generally used should be neglected in
the arrangement.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>When an author is generally known by one of several
forenames he will be looked for by that alone, and
that alone should determine the arrangement, at least
in a card catalogue. Instances are: <em class="embold">Agassiz</em>,
(J:) L: (Rudolph), <em class="embold">Cleveland</em>, (Stephen) Grover,
<em class="embold">Collins</em>, (W:) Wilkie, <em class="embold">Cook</em>, (Flavius
Josephus <i>known</i> <i>as</i>) Joseph, <em class="embold">Dobson</em>, (H:) Austin,
<em class="embold">Doré</em>, (Paul) Gustav. The form should be</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Harte</em>, Bret (<i>full</i> <i>name</i> Francis
Bret), or <em class="embold">Harte</em>, Bret (<i>in</i> <i>full</i>
Francis Bret).</p>

<p>Make references whenever the omission of a name will change
the alphabetical arrangement, as from <em class="embold">Müller</em>, F:
Max, to <em class="embold">Müller</em>, Max.</p>

<p>But if they are counted in arranging they should be spaced
or parenthesized, because when there are several persons
with the same family name the spacing or parenthesizing
assists the eye in picking out the right one. Thus if we
have</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Franklin</em>, John,
<i>d.</i> 1759,</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Franklin</em>, <i>Sir</i>
John, <i>d.</i> 1863,</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Franklin</em>, John
Andrew,</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Franklin</em>, John

D&#x202f;a&#x202f;v&#x202f;i&#x202f;d,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">the reader not knowing of the name David would expect to
find the last among the simple Johns, but seeing the David
spaced would understand that it was a rarely used name.
This supposes that he knows the system, but one can not
have a condensed catalogue without obliging the reader to
learn how to use it. (See § <a href="#a7-140" title="to &#xa7; 140">140</a>.) <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p></div>

<a href="#a7-227" title="to &#xa7; 227">227</a> is required by universal
practice and by the fact that a very large part of the
personal names beginning with prefixes are commonly printed
as one word. Names of places beginning with New, Old, Red,
Blue, Green, etc. (which might be likened to the prefixes
De, Des, Du, etc., and made the ground of a similar
exception), are much less frequently printed as one, and
when they are the accent is different. Moreover the words
New, Old, etc., have an independent meaning and occur as
personal names, first words of titles, or of the names of
societies, as in the examples in § <a href="#a7-230" title="to &#xa7; 230">230</a>. The reason for
separating New Hampshire and Newark in the first example
is patent to every consulter at a glance; the reason for

Under an author’s name adopt the following order: (1)
Complete (or nearly complete) works, (2) Extracts from the
complete works, (3) Single works, whether by him alone or
written in conjunction with another author, (4) Works about
him.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Nos. 1–3 come first as belonging to the author-catalogue; 4

<p>It is better to let the smaller collections come in their
alphabetical place with the single works. The single works
of a voluminous author (as Aristotle, Cicero, Homer,
Shakespere) should be so printed that the different titles
will strike the eye readily. If the “<i>contents</i>” of the
collected words are not printed alphabetically, it is well
to insert under the titles of the chief single works a
reference to the particular volumes of the collections in
which they are to be found. (See Boston Athenæum catal.,
art. <em class="embold">Goethe.</em>) Two works published together are
arranged by the first title, with reference from the second.</p>

<p><i>Extracts</i> from single works come immediately after the
respective works.</p>

<p>A <i>spurious</i> work is arranged with the single works,
but with a note stating the spuriousness. But if the
author’s name is used as a pseudonym the entry should
have a separate heading after all the works; as, <em
class="embold">Browne</em>, <span class="wdspa">H.
History. <em class="embold">Browne</em>,</span> H.,
<span class="wdspa"><i>pseud.</i> Stones</span> from the

class="embold">Ellison</em>, H.</p>

<p>If there are only two <i>joint</i> <i>authors</i> both may appear in
the heading, but the entry should be arranged among the
works written by the first author alone; if there are more
than two the heading may be made in the form <em class="embold">Smith</em>,
John, <i>and</i> <i>others.</i> The usual practice hitherto has been
to arrange entries by joint authors <i>after</i> the works
written by the first author alone, and this was recommended
in the first edition in regard both to the form of the
heading and the arrangement; but although it is pleasing
to a classifying mind, it is practically objectionable
because a reader, not knowing that the book he is looking
for is a joint production, and not finding it in the first
<span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span> series of titles, may suppose that it is not in the
library. This danger is greatest in a card catalogue, where
it entirely overweighs the somewhat visionary advantage
of the separate arrangement. The arrangement of a card
catalogue should be as simple as possible, because the
reader having only one card at a time under his eyes can
not easily see what the arrangement is. On the printed
page, where he takes in many titles at a glance, more
classification can be ventured upon; there the danger is
confined to the more voluminous authors; where there are
few titles the consulter will read them all and so will not
miss any. On the printed page, too, the mixing in of joint
authors interrupts to the eye the alphabetical order of
titles; <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>,</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Dod,</em>
<span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">T.</em> Anamites</span> and their country.</p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—&#x2002;<i>and</i> <span class="wdspa"><i>others.</i> Barracouta.</span></p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—&#x2002;Carriboo, a voyage to the interior.</p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—&#x2002;<i>and</i> White,
<span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">E.</em> Dahomey</span> and the slave trade.</p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—&#x2002;Elephanta, its caves and their images.</p>

<p>This trifling inconvenience can be easily avoided, however,
by including the second name in the title; <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>,</p>

<p class="pexc"><em class="embold">Dod,</em>
<span class="wdspa"><em class="embold">T.</em> Anamites.</span></p>

<p class="pexc">&#x2002;—&#x2002;Barracouta, by D. [and others].</p>

<p>When the form <em class="embold">Smith</em>, John, <i>and</i> <i>others</i> is used,
Full will give a list of the “others” in a note. They are
not put into a heading merely because there is not room for
many names on the first line of a card, and in a printed

than in a very long heading.</p></div>

<p>It is evident how much much more compendious the second
method is. But there is no reason why an alphabetical
“contents” should not be run into a single paragraph.</p>

<p>The titles of novels and plays contained in any
collection ought to be entered in the main alphabet;
it is difficult then to see the advantage of an
alphabetical arrangement of the same titles under the
collection. Many other collections are composed of
works for which alphabetical order is no gain, because
the words of their titles are not mnemonic words,
and it is not worth while to take the trouble of
arranging them; but there are others composed of both
classes, in which such order is very convenient. <span

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-254" class="spa7">254</span>.
Care must be taken not to mix two subjects together
because their names are spelled in the same way.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Thus <em class="embold">Grace</em> before
meals, <em class="embold">Grace</em> of body, <em
class="embold">Grace</em> the musical term, and <em
class="embold">Grace</em> the theological term, must
be four distinct headings.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-255" class="spa7">255</span>.
Under subject-headings group titles topically when it
can be done, otherwise arrange them by the authors’ names.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Alphabetical arrangement by authors’ names is useful when
a subject-entry is a substitute for a title-entry, but
otherwise is as useless as it is inappropriate. If the
author’s name is known the book should be looked for under
that, not under the subject; if it is not known, what good
can an arrangement by authors do? Sometimes, if one has
forgotten the Christian name of an author, it may be easier
to find him under a subject than in a crowd of Smiths or
Joneses or Müllers, and this use of a subject-heading is
impaired by grouping or by chronological order; but such
use is infrequent, and the main design of a subject-entry
should not be subordinated to this side advantage.</p>

<p>It is even urged that it is harder to find a work treating
of the subject in any special way among subdivisions than
when there is only one alphabet, which is absurd. On the
one hand one must look over a list of books embracing five
or six distinct divisions of a subject and select from
titles often ambiguous or provokingly uncommunicative those
that seem likely to treat of the matter in the way desired.
On the other plan he must run over five or six headings
given by another man, and representing that man’s ideas of
classification, and decide under which of them the treatise
he is in search of is likely to be put. Which system gives
the least trouble and demands the least brain-work? Plainly
the latter. In three cases out of four he can comprehend
the system at a glance. And if in the fourth there is a
doubt, and he is compelled after all to look over the whole
list or several of the divisions, he is no worse off than
if there were no divisions; the list is not any longer. The
objection then to subdivisions is not real, but fanciful.
The reader at first glance is frightened by the appearance
of a system to be learned, and perversely regards it as a
hinderance instead of an assistance. But if anyone has such
a rooted aversion to subdivisions it is very easy for him
to disregard them altogether, and read the list as if they
were not there, leaving them to be of service to wiser men.</p>

<p>As the number of titles under each heading increases in
number so does the opportunity and need of division. The
first and most usual groups to be made are <i>Bibliography</i>
and its companion <i>History</i>, and the “practical-form”
groups <i>Dictionaries</i> and <i>Periodicals</i> Under countries
the first grouping will be <i>Description and</i> <i>Travels</i>,
<i>History and</i> <i>Politics</i>, <i>Language and</i> <i>Literature</i>, followed
by <i>Natural</i> <i>history</i>, etc. For examples of further
subdivisions see the longer catalogues. It is not worth
while in a printed catalogue to make very minute divisions.
The object aimed at,—enabling the enquirer to find quickly
the book that treats of the branch of the subject which
<i>he</i> is interested in,—is attained if the mass of titles
is broken up into sections containing from half a dozen to
a score. Of course there are masses of titles which can
not be so broken up because they all treat of the same
subject in the same way, or at least show no difference of
treatment that admits of classification. The general works
on the Fine Arts in a library of 100,000 volumes may number
100 titles, even after <i>Periodicals</i> and <i>Dictionaries</i>
have been set aside.</p>

<p>There is one objection to grouping,—that books can seldom
be made to fill any classification exactly, their contents
overrunning the classes, so that they must be entered
in several places, or they will fail to be found under
some of the subdivisions of which they treat. Thus in the
chronological arrangement of <i>History</i>, whether we arrange
by the first date, the average, or the last date of each
work, the books cover periods of such various length that
one can never get all that relates to one period together.
<span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span> </p>

<p>There is another objection,—that it is much harder to make
a catalogue with subdivisions, which of course require a
knowledge of the subject and examination of the books; and
the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of the
books and the minuteness of the divisions.</p></div>

<p class="pa7">
<span id="a7-256" class="spa7">256</span>.
The subarrangement in groups will often be
alphabetical by authors; but in groups or subjects of a
historical character it should be chronological, the order
being made clear by putting the dates first or by printing
them in heavy-faced type.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Thus under countries the division <i>History</i> will be
arranged according to the period treated of, the earliest
first; so under <i>Description</i>, for England as seen by
foreigners in the days of Elizabeth was a very different
country from the England seen by Prince Pückler-Muskau in
1828, or satirized by Max O’Rell in 1883. So <i>Statistics</i>
and <i>Literature</i>, and other divisions, should be treated
when they are long enough.</p></div>

When the titles are numerous under a subject-heading
divide them, but avoid subdivision.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>It may not be best to adopt strictly the same method in
the subdivisions under countries that was recommended for
government publications. There are advantages in both the
following plans. The second is the dictionary plan pure and
simple; the first is a bit of classification introduced for
special reasons into a dictionary catalogue, and perhaps
out of place there. It is, however, the one which I have
adopted for the catalogue of the Boston Athenæum.</p>

<p>Of course different countries will require different
divisions, e. g., <i>Ecclesiastical</i> <i>history</i>, <i>Mythology</i>,
<i>Religion</i>, <i>Theology</i> will not often be required for
the same <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span> country. And often it will be expedient
to combine those divisions in which there are very few
titles into one more general; thus <i>Botany</i>, <i>Herpetology</i>,
<i>Ichthyology</i>, <i>Zoölogy</i>, would join to give <i>Natural
history</i> a respectable size, and <i>Geology</i>, <i>Mineralogy</i>,
<i>Palæontology</i>, <i>Physical</i> <i>geography</i> would combine, or in
very small countries all these would go together under
<i>Description.</i> Under some countries other divisions will
be required; in the list are given only those in actual
use; but the arrangement is elastic and admits of new
divisions whenever they are needed. In regard to a few
(such as <i>Epitaphs</i>, <i>Fables</i>, <i>Names</i>, <i>Proverbs</i>) there
is room for doubt whether they ought to be under countries;
whether the subject cohesion is not much stronger than the
national cohesion. Many others are not usually put here
(as <i>Numismatics</i>, <i>Philosophy</i>, <i>Religion</i>, <i>Science</i>,
<i>Theology</i>, <i>Zoölogy</i>). The former usage was to put under
the country only its history, travels in it, and the
general descriptive works; and books that treated of the
Art, Architecture, Ballads, Botany, Drama, etc., of that
land were put with the general works on Art, Architecture,
etc. But the tendency of the dictionary catalogue is
towards national classification; that is, in separating
what relates to the parts of a subject, as is required by
its <i>specific</i> principle, it necessarily brings together
all that relates to a country in every aspect, as it would
what relates to any other individual.</p>

<p>It may be asked (1) why the parts of <i>Natural</i> <i>history</i> are
here separated and the parts of <i>Language</i> and <i>Literature</i>
not; and (2) why we do not divide still more (following
out the dictionary plan fully), so as to have divisions
like <i>Liliaceæ</i>, <i>Cows</i>, <i>Horses.</i> As to (2), in a library
catalogue of a million volumes it would no doubt be best
to adopt rigidly this specific mode of entry for the
larger countries; for a catalogue of one or two hundred
thousand, arrangement in classes is as well suited to
quick reference and avoids the loss of room occasioned
by numerous headings. With few books minute division has
a very incomplete appearance, specialties occurring only
here and there, and most of the titles being those of
general works. This may be compared to the division of a
library into alcoves. One of from 10,000 to 20,000 volumes
has an alcove for Natural History; from 20,000 to 50,000
it has alcoves for Botany and for Zoölogy; from 50,000 to
100,000 it has alcoves for Birds, Fishes, Insects, Mammals,
Reptiles, but it must be either very large or very special
before it allows to smaller divisions of Zoölogy separate
apartments. On an expansive system it is easy to make new
alcoves as they are wanted; a similar multiplication by
fission is possible in the successively enlarging editions
of a printed catalogue. A card catalogue, designed for
continuous growth, should have more thorough division
than can be put into print, because it must look into the
future, while the printed catalogue has no future.</p>

<p>As to (1) I can only say that the divisions of <i>Language</i>
seem to me too intimately connected to be dispersed
in catalogues of the present size, but that those of
<i>Literature</i> have a more substantive existence and ought to
be separated sooner. A double subdivision, however, ought
to be avoided. Under <i>Language</i> there should be only one
alphabet. It is better to arrange</p>

<p>Any subdivision of the groups under countries has
been strongly opposed as being troublesome to make,
useless, and even confusing, or as being an unlawful
mixture of classed and dictionary cataloguing.
But suppose you have four or five hundred <span
class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span> titles under <em
class="embold">France.</em> <i>History.</i> Will you break
them up into groups with such headings as <i>House of</i>
<i>Bourbon</i>, <i>Revolution</i>, <i>Empire</i>, <i>Restoration</i>,
etc., with references and other devices for those
works which treat of several periods, all of which
it must be confessed is a little formidable at first
glance, or will you leave them in one undivided mass,
so that he who wants to find the history of the last
half of the 15th century must read through the 500
titles, perhaps, to find even one and certainly to
find all? You would divide of course. It is true
that grouping may mislead. The inquirer must still
be careful to look in several places. The history of
France during the ascendency of the House of Valois
is to be found not merely under that heading but
in the comprehensive histories of the country. The
inquirer may be a little less likely to think of this
because the titles of these two groups are separated
from the many other titles which have nothing to do
specially or generally with the House of Valois, but
if he does think of it he is greatly assisted by such
segregation.</p></div>

particularity of description. If for any reason it is
thought necessary to give a minute account of a book or
of a collection good models may be found in Trömel’s
Biblioth. amér., Lpz., 1861, 8º, Stevens’s Historical
nuggets, Lond., 1862, 2 v. 16º, Weller’s Repertorium
bibliographicum, Nördlingen, 1864, 8º, Harrisse’s Biblioth.
Amer. vetustissima, N. Y., 1866, 8º, Tiele’s Mém. bibliog.
sur les journaux des navig. néerlandaises, Amst., 1867, 8º,
and the titles of the rarer books in Sabin’s Dict. of books
rel. to America, N. Y., 1868, etc. For the convenience of
those who have not these works at hand a few examples are
given here.</p>

<p>This copy has the leaves numbered in ms. and a Tabula
prefixed to the 2d part by a contemporary hand. The work
being very thick was probably in general bound in two parts
and is rarely complete; Santander describes only the 1st
part, the due de la Vallière had only the 2d. The name
of the printer, Zell, is found in only three or four of
his numerous publications. This is shown to be his by the
type, which is the same as that used in the Sermones of R.
Caracciolus de Litio issued in the same year. The present
work went through 10 editions in 8 years. According to
Graesse it is <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span> probably the first book printed out
of Italy which contains a line of Italian poetry, “Trenta
foglie ha la rosa”, at the end of the 1st part.</p>

<p class="fsz6 pa7b">(47) pp. means 47 unnumbered pages, ll. means leaves.
Italicizing the <i>um</i> in Registr<i>um</i> signifies that those

<p class="pa7a">In the heading of titles, the names of authors are to be
given <i>in</i> <i>full</i>, and in their <i>vernacular</i> form, except
that the Latin form may be used when it is more generally
known, the vernacular form being added in parentheses;
except, also, that sovereigns and popes may be given in the
English form.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2a</p>

<p class="pa7a">English and French surnames beginning with a <i>prefix</i>
(except the French de and d’) are to be recorded under the
prefix; in other languages under the word following;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2b</p>

<p class="pa7a">Designations are to be added to <i>distinguish</i> writers of
the <i>same</i> <i>name</i> from each other;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2d</p>

may be added in the heading, when they are part of the
usual designation of the writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2e</p>

<p class="pa7a">Names of places to be given in the English form. When both
an English and a vernacular form are used in English works,
prefer the vernacular.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2f</p>

<h5 class="h5app">TITLES.</h5>

<p class="pa7a">The title is to be an exact transcript of the title-page,
neither amended, translated, nor in any way altered, except
that mottoes, titles of authors, repetitious, and matter of
any kind not essential, are to be <i>omitted.</i> Where great
accuracy is desirable, omissions are to be indicated by
three dots (...). The titles of books especially valuable
for antiquity or rarity may be given in full, with all
practicable precision. The phraseology and spelling, but
not necessarily the punctuation, of the title are to be
exactly copied.&nbsp;&nbsp;(3a</p>

<p class="pa7a">Any <i>additions</i> needed to make the
title clear are to be supplied and inclosed by
brackets.&nbsp;&nbsp;(3b</p>

in <i>English</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;(3c
<ul>
<li class="limarb">to proper names of persons and
personifications, places, bodies, noted events,
and periods (each separate word not an article,
conjunction, or preposition, may be capitalized in
these cases);&nbsp;&nbsp;(3d</li>

<li class="limarb">to adjectives and other derivatives
from proper names when they have a direct reference
to the person, place, etc., from which they are
derived;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3e</li>

<li class="limarb">to the first word of every sentence
and of every quoted title;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3f</li>

<li class="limarb">to titles of honor when
standing instead of a proper name (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>,
the Earl of Derby, but John Stanley, earl of
Derby);&nbsp;&nbsp;(3g</li>

<li class="limarb" id="p102">In <i>foreign</i> languages, according
to the local usage;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3h</li>

<li class="limarb">In doubtful cases capitals are to
be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;(3i</li></ul></li></ul>

<p class="pa7a"><i>Foreign languages.</i>—Titles in foreign characters may be
transliterated. The languages in which a book is written
are to be stated when there are several, and the fact is
not apparent from the title.&nbsp;&nbsp;(3j</p>

<p class="pa7a">A list of <i>abbreviations</i> to be used was given in the
<i>Library</i> <i>journal</i>, 3: 16–20.&nbsp;&nbsp;(6f</p>

<h5 class="h5app">ARRANGEMENT.</h5>

<p class="pa7a">The surname when used alone precedes the same name used
with forenames; where the initials only of the forenames
are given, they are to precede fully written forenames
beginning with the same initials (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, Brown; Brown,

<h4 class="h4m">THE RULES OF THE ENGLISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.</h4>

<p class="pa7a">The cataloguing rules of the Library Association of the
United Kingdom, as revised in 1883, and published in the
<i>Library</i> <i>Chronicle</i> of February, 1885, differ from the A.
L. A. rules in the following points:</p>

<p class="pa7a">1. The order of the imprint is to be: edition, number of
volumes, if only one volume, the number of pages, the
number of separate illustrations, maps, or portraits, the
size, the place of publication, the place of printing when
different from that of publication, the publisher’s name,
and the year.</p>

<p class="pa7a">2. All anonymous works to have the abbreviation “Anon.”
added.</p>

<p class="pa7a">3. Entry under the chief subject-word of the titles of
anonymous books, with a cross-reference, where advisable,
under any other noticeable word.</p>

<p class="pa7a">4. Service and Prayer books used by any religious community
are to be placed under the head of Liturgies, with a
subhead of the religious community.</p>

<p class="pa7a">5. Names of translators, commentators, editors, and preface
writers, if they do not occur in the title-page, may be
added within square brackets, a cross-reference being made
in each case. <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span> </p>

<p class="pa7a">6. It should be noticed that sometimes the respondent and
defender of a thesis are joint authors.</p>

<p class="pa7a">7. All persons generally known by a forename are to be
so entered, the English form being used in the case of
sovereigns, popes, ruling princes, Oriental writers,
friars, and persons canonized.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>[This is like the A. L. A., but differently expressed.]</p></div>

<p class="pa7a">8. [References are required to be always made to the first
word under which a society is entered] from the name of the
place where its headquarters are established.</p>

<p class="pa7a">9. Individual works to be arranged under an author in
alphabetical order of titles, under the first word, not an
article or a preposition having the meaning of “concerning.”</p>

<p class="pa7a">10. The German ä, ö, ü, are to be arranged as if written
out in full—ae, oe, ue.</p>

<p class="pa7a">3. Does not capitalize titles of honor when standing
instead of a proper name.</p>

<p class="pa7a">6. Puts number of volumes before place of publication.
Does not give number of pages, maps, etc. In the case of
books of the 15th and 16th centuries or of special value or
rarity, the names of the publisher and printer are to be

with a cross-reference.</li>

<li class="limarb">(7) <i>Separate</i> <i>works</i>, or entire

<h3 class="h3m">APPENDIX II.</h3>

<h4 class="h4m">REPORT OF THE TRANSLITERATION COMMITTEE.</h4>

<p>[See § <a href="#a7-036" title="to &#xa7;
36">36</a>. This Report was made to the American
Library Association in 1885, and printed in the
Proceedings of the Lake George Conference, and in the
<i>Library</i> <i>journal</i>, 10: 302–8.]</p>

<p>In determining the principles of transliteration it must
be remembered that a catalogue is not a learned treatise
intended for special scholars, and bound to an erudite
consistency, at whatever cost of convenience. It is simply
a key to open the doors of knowledge to a partly ignorant
and partly learned public, and it is very important that
such a key should turn easily. A good catalogue, therefore,
will be a compromise between the claims of learning and
logic on the one hand, and of ignorance, error, and custom
on the other. Speaking generally, that form of name must
be chosen with which people now are, <i>and in the future
will</i> <i>be</i>, most familiar. This reference to the future is
important. The catalogue must not be in advance of its
age; but, on the other hand, it will not be well that
it should be behind the next generation. If, therefore,
there is an evident current of progress in any direction
the makers of the catalogue will do well to be a little
before the present practice, in the hope that the world
will soon catch up with them, not to pass them before
the catalogue itself has been superseded by another. The
larger the catalogue, therefore, and the less likely to be
soon reprinted, the more may it venture to be ahead of the
times. Nevertheless the maker will do well to remember that
the future is very uncertain.</p>

<p>One evident current of progress there is,—in favor of
adopting the continental value of the vowels, representing
the <i>ou</i> sound, for instance, not by <i>ou</i> nor by <i>oo</i> (as
does Dr. Thomas), but by <i>u</i>; writing, therefore, Butan,
not Boutan, nor Bootan, Turgenef and not Tourgueneff; using
also <i>a</i> and not <i>ah</i> for the sound of <i>a</i> in father,
papa (I speak as a New Englander); using the <i>i</i> for the
English <i>e</i> sound; and giving what are unfortunately called
the corresponding short sounds by doubling the following
consonant; thus Nānā would be spelt with one n, but Nanny
with two. This tendency, which has been gathering strength
for some time, has at last received the sanction of an
influential body, the Royal Geographical Society, and can
be followed with safety.</p>

<p>The following notes are taken mostly from Mr. Heilprin’s
articles in the <i>Nation</i>:</p>

<p>1. For ancient <i>Greek</i> names use
the Latin forms, <i>e. g.</i>, Homerus not Homeros, Plato
not Platon, Philippus not Philippos. But where two
forms are in common use choose that which is nearest
the Greek.</p>

<p>2. For <i>Egyptian</i> names known to
us through the Greek, both the Greek and the Egyptian
form (as Cheops and Shufu) should be given, with a
reference from the one which is not chosen for the
main entry.</p>

<p>3. <i>Biblical</i> names are to be
written as we find them in the English Bible, and
the names of post-Biblical Jews, if derived from the
Scriptures, should retain their Anglicized form. On
the other hand, a strict transliteration is demanded
of rabbinical and other more or less pure Hebrew names
which are not taken from Scriptures, and therefore
have no popular English forms, to which, again, there
is an exception in the case of a few celebrated Jewish
authors, as Maimonides, where an un-Hebrew form has
been fully adopted in English literature.</p>

<p>East <i>Indian</i> names have such long accepted forms
that it might well be doubted whether it will do
to use any others. Cashmere, Mooltan, Jellaleddin,
Punjaub, have taken their places in literature and
in the popular mind. Nevertheless, as the better
system which writes Kashmir, Multan, Jalal ud Din,
Panjab, is now adopted in most histories, in all
official documents, among others in Hunter’s great
statistical dictionary of Bengal, it is evident that
it is the coming method, and, in accordance with the
<span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span> principles
already laid down, we are inclined to recommend this
spelling rather than the clumsy English fashion of the
last generation.</p>

<p>All other <i>Asiatic</i> and <i>African</i> names should be
transliterated according to the rules of the Royal
Geographical Society, which we quote here from their
Proceedings for August, 1885 (pp. 535, 536).</p>

<p>The Council of the Royal Geographical Society have adopted
the following rules for such geographical names as are not,
in the countries to which they belong, written in the Roman
character. These rules are identical with those adopted for
the Admiralty charts, and will henceforth be used in all
publications of the <span class="nowrap">society:—</span></p>

<p>1. No change will be made in the orthography of foreign
names in countries which use Roman letters: thus, Spanish,
Portuguese, Dutch, etc., names will be spelt as by the
respective nations.</p>

<p>2. Neither will any change be made in the spelling of such
names in languages which are not written in Roman character
as have become by long usage familiar to English readers:
thus, Calcutta, Cutch, Celebes, Mecca, etc., will be
retained in their present form.</p>

<p>3. The true sound of the word, as locally pronounced, will
be taken as the basis of the spelling.</p>

<p>4. An approximation, however, to the sound is alone aimed
at. A system which would attempt to represent the more
delicate inflections of sound and accent would be so
complicated as only to defeat itself.</p>

<p>5. The broad features of the system are, that vowels are
pronounced as in Italian and consonants as in English.</p>

<p>6. One accent only is used—the acute—to denote the syllable
on which stress is laid.</p>

<p>7. Every letter is pronounced. When two vowels come
together each one is sounded, though the result, when
spoken quickly, is sometimes scarcely to be distinguished
from a single sound, as in <i>ai</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>ei.</i></p>

<p>8. Indian names are accepted as spelt in Hunter’s
<i>Gazetteer.</i></p>

<p>A few points need to be emphasized. Of course the
consonantal sound in <i>itch</i> should never be expressed in
transliteration by the Polish <i>cz</i>, nor by the German
<i>tsch.</i> <i>Tch</i> has been much used for this sound; but the
<i>t</i> is hardly necessary if, as the Geographical Society
recommend, <i>ch</i> is always used with this sound only and
never with the sound <i>sh.</i> Of course there is no reason why
<i>ch</i> should be used in foreign names with the sound <i>sh</i>
any more than <i>j</i> with the sound <i>zh.</i> All that was needed
to prevent ambiguity was for some competent authority to
make a rule; and these rules of the Geographical Society
will no doubt soon be copied into all manuals and followed
by the majority. In this connection we express our regret
that a new edition of Dr. Thomas’s excellent Dictionary of
Biography continues to give his support to what we believe
is an obsolescent system of transliteration.</p>

<p>Nor should the consonantal sound in <i>judge</i> be rendered
by the English <i>dg</i>, nor the French <i>dj</i>, nor the German
<i>dsch</i>, but by <i>j</i> alone. Likewise the consonantal sound in
<i>she</i> is not to be written after the French style, <i>ch</i>,
or as the Germans do, <i>sch.</i> The sound which the French
transliterate by <i>j</i> we must express by <i>zh</i> (<i>e.g.</i>,
Nizhni Novgorod). <i>Tz</i> is best to use in Semitic and Slavic
names, and <i>ts</i> in Japanese and Chinese. For the Semitic
“yod” <i>y</i> is the proper equivalent, and not the German <i>j.</i>
But after a consonant in the same syllable it is usual to
change the <i>y</i> to <i>i</i> (Biela not Byela), and in Russian
names <i>ai</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>oi</i>, <i>ui</i> are used instead of <i>ay</i>,
<i>ey</i>, <i>oy</i>, <i>uy</i> (Alexei not Alexey). After <i>i</i> the <i>y</i> is
dropped (Dobni not Dobniy). <i>W</i> is to be used rather than
<i>i</i> in Arabic names (<i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, Moawiyah). But the Russian,
Serb, Bulgarian, and Wallach contain no such sound or
letter as <i>w</i>, and we must write Paskevitch, Vasili, not as
do the Germans, Paskewitch, Wasili. In the last syllable of
names of places (Azov, Kiev) <i>ev</i> and <i>ov</i> are to be used,
because the Russians used the corresponding letter, though
they pronounce <i>ef</i> and <i>of</i> (in the nominative cases). But
in the last syllable of family names, similarly pronounced,
<i>of</i> and <i>ef</i> may be used, because the Russians sign their
names <i>off</i> and <i>eff</i> when using Roman characters. The last
<i>f</i>, which they use, may be omitted as being plainly not
required to express the sound, and not corresponding to the
Russian character. <i>Kh</i> represents the full guttural, which
the Germans make <i>ch</i> and the Spanish <i>j</i> in Slavic and
Oriental names. <i>H</i> answers to the softer guttural as well
as to the Hebrew <i>he.</i> <i>K</i> answers to the Semitic <i>Kaph</i>
and <i>Koph.</i></p>

<p>The use of <i>ei</i> for the sound of <i>a</i> in fate, <i>ea</i> in
great, <i>ai</i> in trait, is not altogether satisfactory.
It is not easy to see why <i>e</i> was not used to represent
this sound, and <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span> the short <i>e</i>, like the short <i>a</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, indicated by doubling the following
consonant, as Yeddo, Meddina.</p>

<p>The general rule, then, is to use the consonants with their
English value, the vowels with their continental, or, to
speak more exactly, their German and Italian value, for the
French value of <i>u</i> should never be used, and the short
French <i>a</i> requires of us a doubled consonant after it.
Their <i>ou</i> and our <i>oo</i> is quite unnecessary to express the
sound of the last syllable of Timbuctu or Khartum.</p>

<p>Professor Toy, of Harvard University, furnished to the
committee a transliteration table for Semitic languages,
Professor Lanman, of the same University, one for Sanskrit,
and Mr. Heilprin, of the committee, one for Russian.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">L<b>ANMAN</b></span> remarked on his table:</p>

<p>1. It will be observed that each of the five rows numbered
1 to 5 consists of five letters; the second and fourth in
each, <i>i.</i> <i>e.</i>, the aspirates, are often written, especially
in older works, thus, <i>k῾</i>, <i>g῾</i>, <i>c῾</i>, <i>j῾</i>,
<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/tdotbelow-1e6d.png"
width="21" height="82" alt="ṭ" />῾</i>,
<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/ddotbelow-1e0d.png"
width="38" height="82" alt="ḍ" />῾</i>,
<i>t῾</i>, <i>d῾</i>, <i>p῾</i>, <i>b῾</i>; that is, the rough breathing takes
the place of the <i>h.</i></p>

<p>2. Write long vowels with a macron, thus, <i>ā</i>, <i>ī</i>, <i>ū</i>,
<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/r-macron.png"
width="32" height="82" alt="r with macron" /></i>, and not with a circumflex.</p>

<p>3. Wherever you find the combination
<span class="nowrap"><i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/rdotbelow-1e5b.png"
width="30" height="82" alt="ṛ" />i</i>,</span>
with a dot under
the <span class="nowrap"><i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/rdotbelow-1e5b.png"
width="30" height="82" alt="ṛ" /></i>,</span>
reduce it to simple
<span class="nowrap"><i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/rdotbelow-1e5b.png"
width="30" height="82" alt="ṛ" /></i>,</span>
since it is a simple
unitary sound.</p>

<p>4. The palatals (row 2) are often written by means
of the gutturals and an accent: thus, we find <span
class="nowrap"><i>k´</i>&#x2002;<i>k´h</i>&#x2002;<i>g´</i>&#x2002;<i>g´h</i>&#x202f;;</span>
for <span
class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x2002;<i>ch</i>&#x2002;<i>j</i>&#x2002;<i>jh</i></span>
and in some German books <i>c</i> (which has the sound of <i>ch</i>
in <i>church</i>) is written <i>tsch</i>, and <i>j</i> (= <i>j</i> in <i>judge</i>)
in like manner <i>dsch.</i> Further, <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i> are written in
some English works as <i>ch</i> and <i>cch</i>, a useless waste of
labor.</p>

<p>5. When the third palatal is written by
<span class="nowrap"><i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/g-acute.png"
width="40" height="82" alt="g with acute" /></i>,</span> it is common
among the Germans to write the first semi-vowel by <i>j.</i> The
last semi-vowel is often written <i>w</i> (instead of <i>v</i>).</p>

<p>6. The transliteration of the <i>first two</i> <i>sibilants</i> is very
fluctuating. My <i>ç</i>, is written
<span class="nowrap"><i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/s-acute.png"
width="28" height="82" alt="s with acute" /></i>,</span>
by Monier Williams in his dictionary.</p>

<p>The second sibilant is often written <i>sh</i>, sometimes <i>š</i>,
by me as <i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/sdotbelow-1e63.png"
width="28" height="82" alt="ṣ" /></i>, like the other linguals.</p>

<p>7. Finally an <i>s</i> at the end of a Sanskrit word is
converted into an aspiration called <i>risarga</i>, and written
thus <em class="embold">:</em>&#x202f;, and in transliteration is written in this
manner, <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="34" height="82" alt="ḥ" />. The nasality of a vowel is marked by
<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/ndotabove-1e45.png"
width="33" height="82" alt="ṅ" /></i> or
<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/mdotabove-1e41.png"
width="50" height="82" alt="ṁ" /></i> which appears in the Sanskrit as a dot above the body
of the consonant.</p>

<p>For a brief and lucid discussion of these matters and a
defense of the system of Professor Whitney, of Yale, which
is followed in his grammar and in Lanman’s Reader, see The
Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October,
1880, p. xvii.</p>

<span class="hsmall">REPORT ON BOOK SIZES.</span></h3>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>A Special Committee on Book Sizes of the American Library
Association reported (<i>Library</i> <i>journal</i>, 3: 19, 20) the
following rule:</p></div>

<p>Give the outside height in centimeters, using fractions
(decimals) where extreme accuracy is desired. For books
of special forms, prefix sq., ob., or nar., to indicate
square, oblong, or narrow, or else give the actual width
after the height. Add a small “<sup>h</sup>” to the figures giving
the height, except when followed by the width. In the
latter case connect height and width with the ordinary
symbol ×, always giving the height first. If fractious are
not used, give the first centimeter above, <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, all
books between 18 and 19 mark 19<sup>h</sup>, because they fall in the
19th centimeter. For the width, measure the board from the
hinge to the edge, not including the round. If desirable
to give the size of the paper or letter-press, prefix the
measurement with p(aper) or t(ype), including in the type
neither folio nor signature lines.</p>

<p>For those preferring to use the common designations, the
following-rule was unanimously recommended:</p>

<p>Designate each size by its initial letter or letters
(followed, if preferred by the cataloguer, by its final
letter “o,” superior “º”) assigning the size by the
following table, and prefixing sq., ob., nar., if the books
be square, oblong, or narrow. Give the exact measurement of
all size-curiosities, whether very large or very small.</p>

</table>

<p>Any cataloguer desiring to use the term E (18º) may do so
by calling the smaller S (16º). This causes no confusion,
for either E or S is between 15 and 17&#xfeff;½ cm. in height.
Books from 20 to 40 cm. high may be called sm. Q, Q, and l.
Q when of the square form, but O, l. O, and F, or sm. F,
when of the ordinary form. Books smaller than 20 cm., and
of the quarto form, are marked sq. D, etc. * * *</p>

<p>The plan of giving the height in centimeters
has the advantage that, once stated, it will never
be forgotten. By it the size is more easily <span
class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span> determined,
more quickly recorded, much more definite in its
description, and, most important of all, is understood
by all users of catalogues after the first time,
while the other systems are intelligible only to
those familiar with books. The committee therefore
recommends the plan of <i>indicating the size by giving
the</i> <i>size.</i></p>

<h3 class="h3m">APPENDIX IV.
<span class="hsmall">
MR. EDMANDS ON ALPHABETICAL ORDER.</span></h3>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>Mr. J. Edmands, in “Rules for alfabeting,” read at the
meeting of the American Library Association in August,
1887, and published in the <i>Library</i> <i>journal</i>, 12: 326–341,
discussed the subject carefully. A committee of the
Association was directed to prepare a code of rules, to be
reported in the <i>Library</i> <i>journal</i>; for their report see
14: 273–274. Their code coincides with mine (§§ <a href="#a7-214" title="to &#xa7; 214">214</a>–239),
except (1) that they adopt my former order, “person,
place, title, subject (except person and place), form,”
and not the present rule (§ <a href="#a7-214" title="to &#xa7; 214">214</a>), “person, place, followed
by subject (except person and place), form and title,”
an arrangement which probably was not proposed to the
committee; and (2) that when two or more names are spelled
exactly alike except for the umlaut in names in which the
German ä, ö, or ü may occur, the committee put all the
names having the umlaut last, <i>e.</i> <i>g.</i>, all the Müllers
after the Mullers. I arrange by the forenames.</p>

<p>Mr. Edmands correctly states as the principle of
alphabeting “<i>Something follows</i> <i>nothing</i>; or, conversely,
<i>Nothing before</i> <i>something</i>; thus in</p>

<p class="pexc">Art of living</p>
<p class="pexc">Arthur</p>

<p class="pexc padtopc">In clover</p>
<p class="pexc">Incas</p>

<p class="pcontinue">the <i>art</i>, in the first case, and
the <i>in</i>, in the second, ar followed by a space, i.
e., by <i>nothing</i>, and so precede the single word in
which the t and the n are followed by a letter; i. e.,
by <i>something.</i>”</p>

<p>His Rules agree with those stated or implied in § <a href="#a7-214" title="to &#xa7; 214">214</a> and
following sections, with three exceptions. The first is
this:</p></div><!--ddetaila-->

<p>“A word used independently as a subject heding should
precede the same word used in connection with another.
And if this word is coupled with another word to form
a compound subject heding, it should follow the simple
heding. And if this word used as a simple heding is also
used a substantiv to form a different subject heding, and
is also used adjectivly before a noun, the substantiv use
should precede the adjectiv use. And so we hav this order:</p>

<p class="pexc">Art</p>
<p class="pexc">Art and artists</p>
<p class="pexc">Art of conversation</p>
<p class="pexc">Art amateur</p>

<p>“The reasons for it ar clear and strong. A substantiv
should precede an adjectiv, as being the more important
word, and as being less closely connected with the
following than an adjectiv. In uttering the frases Art
applied to industry, Art of conversation, there is a
perceptible suspension of the voice after the word Art,
which does not occur in the case of Art journal, art
amateur.”</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>The reason is not strong enough to justify
interfering with the alphabetical order, which demands
that amateur shall precede and. It is needless to
compel the searcher to stop and think whether the word
“art” in the phrase he is hunting for is a noun <span
class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span> or an adjective;
indeed, it is not only a useless refinement, but
positively dangerous, as likely occasionally to
lead him to overlook an entry which is out of its
alphabetical order.</p>

<p>The same objection applies to the practice of some
cataloguers of putting the plural immediately after the
singular, even when the alphabet demands that it should
precede (as Charities, Charity), or when many entries might
come between (as between Bank and Banks). This practice Mr.
Edmands condemns.</p>

<p>The second exception is this:</p></div><!--ddetaila-->

<p>“A single ful name should precede a double initial, i. e.,
a surname with one Christian name should stand before the
same surname with two Christian names; thus,</p>

<p class="pexc">John,</p>
<p class="pexc">J. M.,</p>

<p class="pcontinue spitalic">not</p>

<p class="pexc">J. M.</p>
<p class="pexc">John.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>This plainly contradicts the principle “nothing before
something.” A period is too trifling a matter to arrange
by, and neglecting that</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft"></td>
 <td class="tdleft">J followed by nothing</td>
 <td class="tdleft">J</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">should precede</td>
 <td class="tdleft">J followed by o,</td>
 <td class="tdleft">John.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The third exception is this:</p></div><!--ddetaila-->

<p>A book written by a single author should precede one
written by him and another.</p>

<div class="ddetaila">
<p>(See the argument in the note to § <a href="#a7-240" title="to &#xa7; 240">240</a>.)</p>

<p>The rules which agree are in substance as follows:</p></div>

<p><i>New.</i> Titles with the initial word New used as a proper
adjective followed by a common noun, and those in which it
forms a part of a compound place name should be arranged in
one series, alfabeting by the last part. (New Amsterdam,
new boat, New Canaan, new life.) Single words beginning
with <em class="embold">new</em>, whether names of persons, places, or
things, should be arranged in a following alfabetical
series.</p>

<p>The <i>hyfen</i> is best disregarded, words connected by it
being arranged as two words.</p>

<p>If an <i>article</i>, which belongs before a word used as a
heding, is inserted after it, it is not to be taken account
of in alfabeting.</p>

<p>The <i>plural</i> in s should follow the singular. The
<i>possessive</i> case singular should follow the singular and
precede the plural in s. The sequence, however, may not in
either case be immediate. Several entries may intervene.
Plurals in ies of words ending in y should precede the
singular, tho not necessarily in immediate connection.</p>

<p><i>Common and proper</i> <i>nouns.</i> In the case of words used
sometimes as common and sometimes as proper nouns, the true
order is person, place, and thing.</p>

<p><i>Surnames.</i> Whenever a single name. Charles, Henry,
William, is used as the sole designation of a person, this
should precede the same word used as a surname. If several
ranks are represented by one name, precedence should be
given to those bearing the highest rank in this order,
pope, emperor, king, noble, saint. If these represent
different nationalities they should be groupt in the
alfabetical order of the countries; and numerically under
each country, as John I., John II. <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span> </p>

<p>Family names that hav the same sound, but a different
spelling, must be separated, but the reader should be aided
as much as we can by a free use of cross references.</p>

<p>In names beginning with La, Le, and De—not French
names—written separately, it is better to disregard the
separation, and arrange these words as if they were written
solidly.</p>

<p><i>Abbreviations.</i> Names beginning with M’, Me, St, and
Ste should be arranged as if written out in ful, as Mac,
Saint, and Sainte, for the reason that they ar uniformly
so pronounct, and often so written. And for the same
reason entries beginning with Dr., M., Mme., Mlle., Mr.,
and Mrs. should be treated as if they were written in ful,
as Doctor, Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle, Mister, and
Mistress.</p>

<p><i>Forenames.</i> When Christian names ar given in ful, the
arrangement should be in strict alfabetical order,
following the surname. And use should be made of all the
helps which the cataloger has given for distinguishing two
or more persons whose names ar identical.</p>

<p><i>Titles</i>, such as Gen., Don., Sir, ar to be allowed to
stand, but not to affect the arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Numerals</i> occurring as hedings should be treated as if
written out in letters. The novel “39 men for one woman”
should be entered under t.</p>

<p><i>Initials.</i> If the cataloger has simply followed the
title-page and given only initials of Christian names, the
only safe course is to treat every initial as a name; and,
on the axiom “Nothing before something,” the initial should
precede the ful name. Thus J. precedes James even tho, as
may afterwards be learned, the J. stands for Jehoshaphat.</p>

<p><i>Dash.</i> In order to save space in printing, and for
distinctness to the eye, it is wel to use a dash to
represent a word or group of words that might otherwise hav
to be repeated; or to inset the words that come under the
general heding. Care should be taken to make clear what
the dash stands for, and to confine its use within proper
bounds.</p>

<p>It may be used when we hav several books written by one
person; but it should not be used to cover another person
of the same surname.</p>

<p>It may be used to represent a word or group of words that
indicate a definite subject, as heat, moral science,
socialists and Fourierism, society for the diffusion of
useful knowledge. But it should not be used to represent a
part of a compound subject-heding, nor a part of a title;
e. g., in the entries Historical portraits, Historical
reading, the word Historical should be spelled out in each
case.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3m">APPENDIX VI.</h3>

<p>So far we have been considering only the catalogue by which
the library communicates with the public; but a librarian
needs several others for library service: (1) The Catalogue
of books ordered; (2) The Accessions catalogue; (3) The
Periodical-and continuation-book; (4) The Shelf-list; (5)
The Catalogue of books missing; (6) The Tract-catalogue;
(7) The Catalogue of duplicates to be sold; (8) The
Catalogue of duplicates sold or exchanged.</p>

<p>(2) and (8) are necessary for the preservation of the
history of the library and important in its financial
management.</p>

<p>(6) is a modification of (5). It is a list of the tracts
contained in bound volumes, by which the abstraction of
any particular tract can be ascertained, or the extent of
the loss if the whole volume disappears. All this might be
entered on the shelf-list, but it is more convenient to
keep the record of the tract-volumes together. Sometimes
part of a tract-list is inserted in the public catalogue.
You may see collections of pamphlets on various subjects
by various authors recorded under a made-up heading
<em class="embold">Tracts</em>, or <em class="embold">Pamphlets</em>, a style of entry that
is nearly useless. The whole of the Prince catalogue of
1846 was made in this absurd way. A number of tracts by
a single author may indeed for economy be catalogued
under him in one mass like a “contents,” and the same may
be <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span> done for tracts on a single subject, though
there are objections even to this; but to catalogue the
writings of several authors under an arbitrary heading (as
<em class="embold">Plays</em>, <em class="embold">Speeches</em>, <em class="embold">French</em>
<em class="embold">Revolution</em>),
to which references merely are made under the authors, is
to be economical at altogether too great an expense of
trouble to the public,—to say nothing of the incongruity of
a form or subject heading for an author-entry.</p>

<p>(4), the shelf-list, ought to be so made (<i>a</i>) that the
entry of each book in the catalogue can be readily found
from it; (<i>b</i>) that the book can be readily identified
with the entry on the shelf-list; (<i>c</i>) that at the annual
examination or taking account of stock the shelf-reader
shall know at once what book is meant as each title is
read by the list-reader. For these reasons the list should
contain the author’s name (or first word, etc., if the book
is anonymous), part of the real title, the binder’s title
(which will generally be the same as the real), and the
place and date of printing. If the author’s name, or any
part of the title, is not on the back of the book it should
be inclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">A briefer shelf-list can be made by merely entering the
book’s number and the accessions number, so that the
full title can be found if needed by referring to the
accessions-book.</p>

<p>(2), (3), and (8) are best kept in books; (4) and (6) on
separate sheets of paper; (1), (5), and (7) on cards. When
the catalogue is kept on cards (5) can be made by merely
separating the cards of such books as are missing.</p>

<p>(1). After some experiments I have preferred the following
method of keeping the order-list. The titles of books
proposed for purchase are type-written on ruled slips of
stiff paper 12&#xfeff;½ cm. long by 5 cm. wide. If approved by
the committee a check is made at the left of the title. A
searcher then ascertains whether the library already has
the book; if it has, the card is destroyed or sent with
this information to the person who asked for the book; if
not, the searcher puts her initials and the date in the
lower left-hand corner. The cards are then sorted into
parcels for the English, French, or German agents; and an
order is written, the writer first making sure, by looking
among the cards of previous orders, that none of the books
has already been sent for. In the order a running number is
given to each title and a corresponding number is put on
the card.</p>

<p>The name of the author is entered in a book opposite the
running number, and the date is put there against the
first number of each order.&#x2009;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn73" id="fnanc73">[73]</a>
The cards are then all
stamped on the left with the date, and put away in a
drawer alphabetically with other cards of books ordered.
When a <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span> box of books comes, the corresponding cards
are picked out and stamped on the right with the date.
They receive the accessions-number when the books are
entered on the accessions-catalogue, the class-number when
the books are placed, and are corrected when the books
are catalogued; for, having usually been written from
advertisements, these cards are often incorrect. When a
number have accumulated they are sorted in the order of
class-numbers and the entry on the class-catalogue is made
from them. They are then put away alphabetically in drawers
accessible only to the library-attendants, and form the
index of the accessions-book. When a duplicate volume is
exchanged or sold the date, its price, and receiver are
noted on the order card.</p>

<p>The system is economical. One card serves many purposes and
with little writing answers all the questions likely to
come up: Has this book been proposed to the Book Committee?
(Books rejected are kept in a separate drawer.) Has it been
approved? Ordered? When? From whom? Who is responsible
for the error if it turns out a duplicate? When was it
received? Where is it entered in the Accessions-catalogue
(that we may ascertain its price and condition)? Where was
it first located? If any one of the questions is not to be
asked then the corresponding process can be dispensed with.
The list, of which an example is given in the note below,
is not necessary but convenient.</p>

<span class="hsmall">SOME WORKS OF REFERENCE.</span></h3>

<p>I have set down here chiefly those works which
I find to be of <i>constant</i> use in cataloguing. One
occasionally needs many more, even for a short
investigation. A complete and systematic view of
bibliographical literature is given in Petzholdt’s
“Bibliotheca bibliographica. Leipzig, 1866,” and
many of the more modern works may be found in
Vallée’s Bibliographie des bibliographies, Paris,
1883, and supplement, 1887. Powers’ “Handy-book
about books. London, 1870,” contains a useful list,
which is reprinted, with additions, in Sabin’s
“American bibliopolist.” C: H. Hull’s “Help’s for
cataloguers in finding full names” in the <i>Library</i>
<i>journal</i>, Jan., 1889, gives an excellent classified
list with descriptive notes. <span class="xxpn"

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have
been generally retained, with some exceptions noted
below. Original printed page numbers are shown like
this: {52}. Footnotes and other anchored notes have
been relabeled 1–73, and moved from within paragraphs
to nearby locations between paragraphs. I produced the
cover image and hereby assign it to the public domain.</p>

<p>Large curly brackets that graphically indicate
combination of information on two or more lines of
text have been removed. The text was modified, if necessary, to retain
the original meaning. In most cases, as on page <a
href="#p008" title="to &#x70;age 8">8</a>, this was
trivial. However, the task was not trivial for the
chart beginning at the bottom of page <a href="#p011"
title="to &#x70;age 11">11</a>, so errors of
interpretation are not impossible. For reference, the
original image is shown below.</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<p>The original Table of Contents failed to connect reliably
with the text. The original has been severely overhauled,
without further comment here.</p>

<p>Precise horizontal spacing of words
is essential in this
book. But precise horizontal spacing is
difficult to attain in an ebook, given the
constraints necessarily imposed upon us. Browser
support of html and css varies considerably;
support for specialized Unicode space characters varies;
the ebook product must
be readable on many different devices with widely
varying screen sizes; and users may choose from many
widely different fonts. The following example of a
catalogue entry is taken from page
<a href="#p090" title="to &#x70;age 90">90</a>.</p>

lists, which do not comprise a table.
Catalogue 2 has been moved after catalogue 1, and new

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
